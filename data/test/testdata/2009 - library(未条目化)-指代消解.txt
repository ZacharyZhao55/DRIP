1.System administrators can create reliable report templates that are available to staff, and can be run as is or modified to the staff person's particular needs.
Changes in the templates could be done without comprising the results.
The administrator can limit the filters and display fields that can be altered to certify a dependable output. For example, front-line staff could set the call number range for a weeding report or add or remove designated display fields from a pick list, but couldn't alter the template to display deleted items.
2.System provides distinct, fine-grained permission levels limiting who can create and clone reports. All permissions should be easy to administer.
System administrators can create shared folders to allow or disallow staff to run specific reports, and/or to run ad hoc reports on specific sets of data.
3.System provides a user-friendly interface for designing queries against all record types. Staff can select fields to query; select values from picklist of possible values; select regular expressions from drop-down menu, and use a full range of Boolean operators.
Administrators control staff access to tables and fields.
4.The system provides pre-defined reports for consumption by library boards or other consumers. There will be reports providing basic statistics like those required by the Georgia Annual Report and Application for State Aid and activity reports that indicate traffic and volume of use that display statistics on check-outs, check-ins, holds placed, and holds filled. It should be possible cross-tabulated per terminal, per branch, per library system, per hour, per patron age range, per patron type, and per patron location.
5.Examples of periodic reports: bibliographic records with holds; items that have not been checked out in X days; item-level holds; items with invalid item type; in-transit items with outstanding hold; items that have been in-transit for more than X days; items that are the last copy in the system; items with a long call number; missing items; bibliographic records with no item records; patrons with invalid home library.
6.The system produces statistics that can be used to understand and predict patron behavior and use of materials. For example, how quickly is a particular book returned, on average? How likely is a particular book to be renewed? What percent of check-outs at a particular branch are renewals?
7.The system produces useful demographic statistics, including transactions by geographical regions, age ranges, etc The data used to produce useful demographic statistics, including transactions by geographical regions, age ranges, etc must be anonymized, ie information that could be used to identify a patron is deleted.
8.Ability to report on the volume of material in a given library at any point in time, based on new acquisitions, items on the shelf, and items out in circulation, with the ability to break down volume in categories (eg total items in library, number of holds, number of adult fiction, number of board books, etc).
9.For each genre and format of material, ability to compare the percentage of total circulations, the percentage of the collection, and the percentage of total shelf space that genre/format comprises. Ability to report per library and per system.
10.Ability to control inventory of uncataloged material, such as paperback books and children's board books. Support for quick distribution; minimal branch labor; and ability to identify how the material is being used. Ability to count transactions and include in circulation statistics and reports.
11.System provides a utility for transferring batches of items between branches, used for example to move books into a mobile library, an outreach program collection, or a "just-in-time" warehouse. Utility includes ability to query for candidate materials; ability to save queries for repeated use; ability to manually select titles from query results; and ability to change records of all or selected items to move to new location.
Mechanisms for moving items include changing location field, generating pull lists, etc In addition, utility provides means to revert items to original location after a set period of time, and/or based on other criteria.
12.The system generates a list of items that have been in-transit for more than X days (X configurable), per branch and per system.  The report would merge the transit to and transit from into one report for ease of front-line staff use.
13.The system provides a utility and reports for identifying item records to purge, based on customizable criteria such as: an item has been in status "missing" for more than X months; an item has status "discard/weed".
system has a report to assist in the conversion of items from one status to another.
system provides a last copy report that would single out a library system's last copies, to assist catalogers who need to edit WorldCat entries.
system provides a quick effective method of deleting volume entries along with copy entries, as well as records with no items attached.
14.Transactions can be grouped by hour, terminal, branch, and system.
Transactions include check-ins, check-outs, fines collected, patron registrations, etc, and can be queried by all transactions or by type of transaction.
15.The system can generate a report of transactions (holds placed, holds filled, and check-outs) per patron, per library, per selected group o libraries, per system, per county.
The system displays the number of check-outs and placed holds per patron. Holds are subtotaled by type, eg active, frozen, and frozen-until holds.
16.The system can generate a report of the value of items (based on data in item record) in the entire collection or a portion. Example: staff can obtain value of all items with status of longoverdue, or value of all dvds in children's collection, or value of entire collection.
17.Fines, charges, waivers, and ecommerce transactions are attached to patron and item records.
System tracks fines waived and payments made per library. Financial information can be updated easily. As an example, a staff user can easily query patron accounts with balances greater than X dollars.
18.The system provides financial reports including: patron account balances by patron, home library, and system; fines and charges accrued per time period (eg last twelve months, YTD, last month) and per type of charge (overdue fines, damaged item charges, lost item charges, etc); fines waived per time period and per branch; payments made per time period and per payment method (eg staff desk, self-check station, OPAC).
