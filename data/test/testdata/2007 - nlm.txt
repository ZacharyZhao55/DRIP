1.Ingest provides the services and functions to accept Submission Information Packages (SIPs) from producers (or from internal elements under Administration control) and prepare the contents for storage and management within the archive.  Ingest functions include receiving SIPs, performing quality assurance on SIPs, generating an Archival Information Package (AIP) which complies with the archive's data formatting and document standards, extracting Descriptive Information from the AIPs for inclusion in the archive database, and coordinating updates to Archival Storage and Data Management.
2.The Receive Submission function provides the appropriate storage capability or devices to receive a SIP from the Producer (or from Administration). Digital SIPs may be delivered via electronic transfer (eg, FTP), loaded from media submitted to the archive, or simply mounted (eg, CD-ROM) on the archive file system for access. Non-digital SIPs would likely be delivered by conventional shipping procedures. The Receive Submission function may represent a legal transfer of custody for the Content Information in the SIP, and may require that special access controls be placed on the contents. The Receive Submission function provides a confirmation of receipt of a SIP to the Producer, which may include a request to resubmit a SIP in the case of errors resulting from the SIP submission.
3.A minimal set of identifying information/metadata concerning rejected submissions should provide a mechanism to eliminate the need to review some resubmissions. Certain reasons for rejection should prevent a possible resubmission.
4.Assigns a unique identifier to each object.
Submitted content may be composed of multiple items, and the system must maintain the relationship between the parent object and any subsequent child objects (ie, tracking of unique identifiers for child objects and the parent object; possible inheritance of parent object identifier to child objects).
5.The Quality Assurance function validates (QA results) the successful transfer of the SIP to the staging area. For digital submissions, these mechanisms might include Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRCs) or checksums associated with each data file, or the use of system log files to record and identify any file transfer or media read/write errors.
6.The Generate AIP function transforms one or more SIPs into one or more AIPs that conform to the archive's data formatting and documentation standards. This may involve file format conversions, data representation conversions or reorganization of the content information in the SIPs.
Generate AIP function may issue report requests to Data Management to obtain reports of information needed by the Generate AIP function to produce the Descriptive Information that completes the AIP.
Generate AIP function sends SIPs or AIPs for audit to the Audit Submission function in Administration, and receives back an audit report.
7.The Generate Descriptive Information function extracts Descriptive Information from the AIPs and collects Descriptive Information from other sources to provide to Coordinate Updates, and ultimately Data Management. This includes metadata to support searching and retrieving AIPs (eg, who, what, when, where, why), and could also include special browse products (thumbnails, images) to be used by Finding Aids.
8.The Coordinate Updates function is responsible for transferring the AIPs to Archival Storage and the Descriptive Information to Data Management. Transfer of the AIP includes a storage request and may represent an electronic, physical, or a virtual (ie, data stays in place) transfer. After Transfer of the AIP is completed and verified, Archival Storage returns a storage confirmation indicating (or verifying) the storage identification information for the AIP.
Coordinate Updates function also incorporates the storage identification information into the Descriptive Information for the AIP and transfers the AIP to the Data Management entity along with a database update request. In return, Data Management provides a database update response indicating the status of the update. Data Management updates may take place without a corresponding Archival Storage transfer when the SIP contains Descriptive Information for an the AIP already in Archival Storage.
9.Archival Storage provides the services and functions for the storage, maintenance and retrieval of AIPs.  Archival Storage functions include receiving AIPs from Ingest and adding Ingest to permanent storage, managing the storage hierarchy, refreshing the media on which archive holdings are stored, performing routine and special error checking, providing disaster recovery capabilities, and providing AIPs to Access to fulfill orders.
10.The Receive Data function receives a storage request and an AIP from Ingest and moves AIP to permanent storage within the archive. a storage request and an AIP from Ingest may need to indicate the anticipated frequency of utilization of the data objects comprising AIP in order to allow the appropriate storage devices or media to be selected for storing AIP. This function will select the media type, prepare the devices or volumes, and perform the physical transfer to the Archival Storage volumes. Upon completion of the transfer, This function sends a storage confirmation message to Ingest, including the storage identification of the AIPs.
11.The Manage Storage Hierarchy function positions, via commands, the contents of the AIPs on the appropriate media based on storage management policies, operational statistics, or directions from Ingest via the storage request. the storage request will also conform to any special levels of service required for the AIP, or any special security measures that are required, and ensures the appropriate level of protection for the AIP. These include on-line, off-line or near-line storage, required throughput rate, maximum allowed bit error rate, or special handling or backup procedures. the storage request monitors error logs to ensure AIPs are not corrupted during transfers. This function also provides operational statistics to Administration summarizing the inventory of media on-hand, available storage capacity in the various tiers of the storage hierarchy, and usage statistics.
12.The Replace Media function provides the capability to reproduce the AIPs over time. Within the Replace Media function the Content Information and Preservation Description Information (PDI) must not be altered. However, the data constituting the Packaging Information may be changed as long as the Packaging Information continues to perform the same function and there is a straightforward implementation that does not cause information loss.
The migration strategy must select a storage medium, taking into consideration the expected and actual rates of errors encountered in various media types, The migration strategy performance, and The migration strategy costs of ownership. If media-dependent attributes (eg, tape block sizes, CD-ROM volume information) have been included as part of the Content Information, a way must be found to preserve the Content Information when migrating to higher capacity media with different storage architectures. Anticipating the terminology of section 0, this function may perform Refreshment, Replication, and Repackaging that is straightforward. An example of such Repackaging is migration to new media under a new operating system and file system, where the Content Information and PDI are independent of the file systems. However, complex repackaging and all transformation are performed under Administration supervision by the Archival Information Update function to ensure information preservation.
13.The Error Checking function provides statistically acceptable assurance that no components of the AIP are corrupted during any internal Archival Storage data transfer.
Error Checking function requires that all hardware and software within the archive provide notification of potential errors and that potential errors are routed to standard error logs that are checked by the Archival Storage staff. The PDI Fixity Information provides some assurance that the Content Information has not been altered as the AIP is moved and accessed. Similar information is needed to protect The PDI Fixity Information.
A standard mechanism for tracking and verifying the validity of all data objects within the archive may also be used. For example, CRCs could be maintained for every individual data file. A higher level of service, such as Reed-Solomon coding to support combined error detection and correction, could also be provided. The storage facility procedures should provide for random verification of the integrity of data objects using CRCs or some other error checking mechanism.
14.The Disaster Recovery function provides a mechanism for supplicating the digital contents of the archive collection and storing the duplicate in a physically separate facility.
Disaster Recovery function is normally accomplished by copying the archive contents to some form of removable storage media (eg digital linear tape, compact disc), but may also be performed via hardware transport or network data transfers.
The details of disaster recovery policies are specified by Administration.
15.The Provide Data function provides copies of stored AIPs to Access. This function receives an AIP request that identifies the requested AIP(s) and provides an AIP request that identifies the requested AIP(s on the requested media type or transfers an AIP request that identifies the requested AIP(s to a staging area.

Typical reports might include summaries of archive holdings by category, or usage statistics for accesses to archive holdings. It may also receive a report request from Access and provides descriptive information for a specific AIP.
20.The Receive Database Updates function adds, modifies or deletes information in the Data Management persistent storage. The main sources of updates are Ingest, which provides Descriptive Information for the new AIPs, and Administration, which provides system updates and review updates. Ingest transactions consist of Descriptive Information which identifies new AIPs stored in the archive. System updates include all system-related information (operational statistics, Consumer information, and request status). Review updates are generated by periodic reviewing and updating of information values (eg, contact names, and addresses). Receive Database Updates function provides regular reports to Administration summarizing the status of updates to the database, and also sends a database update response to Ingest.
