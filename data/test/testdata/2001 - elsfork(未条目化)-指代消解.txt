1.Basically the communication system must assist the operators, users and other interested parties in performing users and other interested parties tasks by provision of services.
the communication system must be flexible in supporting future requirements and future developments.
the communication system must be open in the sense that 'anyone shall be able to get information on anything from anywhere', once they have authorization to the communication system. the communication system thus shall be adapted to individual users and services provided accordingly by means of configurations, set-ups etc.
2.The communication system shall be based on open and widely accepted methods with a high degree of interface possibilities.
communication system shall be robust and reliable, but communication system shall not be used for the safe and secure operation of the plant.
Faults in communication system shall not cause malfunction of an individual wind turbine.
communication system shall be designed in a way that faults of a sub-system interferes as little as possible with functions of communication system as a whole.
3.In designing the system the system shall be taken into account, that the physical environment at the plant typically has a wide span of temperature, moisture, salinity and vibration levels.
4.Secondary systems may be for example Beacons (sea and air), Fire protection, Emergency alarm, Intruder alarm, Power supplies and emergency power systems, Meteorological stations, Safety systems for personnel, Data logger systems and Condition monitoring.
Condition monitoring will be very important for offshore wind farms and Condition monitoring will be a standard function in all larger wind turbines.
5.The condition monitoring system provides status and analysis reports for components. 
The analysis may be in the form of spectres, trends, statistic figures, time tracking etc.
6.The values shall be available for display on operator HMI as well as for storage (databases).
Updating of values shall be selectable down to an interval of 1 sec.
All data must be stored in the plant controller for transmission on demand.
Transfer of data from the buffers may be carried out off-line without synchronism with real-time.
7.The basic functions of the system can be grouped in two main categories, Operational or control functions and System management functions
8.A third group is Process automation functions, which involve functions that operate with process data directly without the involvement of an operator. However third group is not within the scope of this specification and is not further treated.
9.The operational functions are needed for the normal daily operation of the wind power plant. In these functions an HMI, either local or remote, is included.
The operational functions are used to present process or system information to an operator or to provide him the control by commands.
The operational functions include the following.
10.Access to operational functions has to be controlled by a set of rules. 
Access control is to allow the capability to restrict an authenticated client to a pre-determined set of services and objects.
11.Local or remote monitoring of the status and changes of states (indications) for operational devices.
12.Control function allows an operator or an automatic function to operate equipment like switchgear or transformer, a protection, etc.
Control is subject to miscellaneous filters that check that there will be no damage if the control is issued.
13.In addition to single parameters, an application may have several possible pre-defined parameter sets (but only one active set).
14.Alarm is generated when a data of the system takes a value that shall be specially considered by the operator, there is a need for attracting attention to some abnormal state.
Alarm management functions allow an operator to visualise, acknowledge and clear alarms.
15.Functions for continuous scanning of devices for alarms, operator control actions and changes in state, and for recording the events chronologically with date and time information.
16.Functions for a follow-up of parameter settings should include services to retrieve all parameters (names, values and units for all setpoints) or to retrieve only those that differ from the default values.
17.Data retrieval for the purpose if display and bulk data storage of fault data.
18.System management functions include both functions for system support and for system configuration and maintenance.
System support functions are used to manage the system itself ( Network management, Time synchronization, and Self-checking of communication equipment).
System support functions support the total system and have no direct impact on the process.
System configuration or maintenance functions are used to set-up or evolve (maintain) the total system.
System configuration or maintenance functions include the setting and changing of configuration data and the retrieval of configuration information from the total system.
The most important examples of System Management functions are.
19.Functions needed to configure and maintain the communication network. The basic task is the identification of communication objects/devices.
20.Synchronization of devices within a communication system.
21.The self-check detects if an object or device is fully operational, partially operational or not operational.
22.The software management include version control, download, activation and retrieval of software.
23.The function is used to download, activate and retrieve configuration data
24.Allows an authorised operator to start and stop functions or objects within the system, including manual activation or reset of subsystems.
25.The setting function allows an operator read and to change on or more parameters affecting the behaviour of the object/device.
26.Possibility to check a function but avoiding impact on the process (blocking of process outputs).
27.Function to allow control and supervision of the security of the system against unauthorised access or loss of activity.
28.The functions here described are not within the scope of this Specification, that is communication for remote operation. However, from an overall communication system point of view, it can be desired that all communication have to be able to coexist on the same transmission media.
29.Local system functionality for hook-up for temporary data transmission is not within the scope of this specification. Thus the communication system for remote operation do not need to support functions such as hook-up of portable PC at the plant for Internet access, WEBcam connection, E-mail service, Program execution, Plant information and Service instructions.
30.A verbal dialogue system ( telephone) is essential for contacts between operation and maintenance personnel in the wind power plant and the control centre operator.
Video communication may also facilitate the co-operation between field personnel and control centre personnel.
Video may also be used for supervision of equipment. However these function is not within the scope of this specification.
31.Functions that are of no relevance to the wind power plant or wind turbine operators, the most important actors, are considered to be out of scope. Energy accounting for the network operator is one example.
32.In this section the requirements on the communication between the different units in the system are specified.
33.In wind farms a local communication system might be the link between overall control units and the individual wind turbine controller.
An overall control unit may be a 'wind farm main controller' conducting an overall governing of the plant output and the grid compatibility.
35.A specific kind of data put specific requirements on the communication system. Alarms, for example, need to reach the remote control centre much faster than events. And the latter is often grouped with other events before transmission.
The mapping between the different kinds of data, the data transfer principles and the operational functions are described in section 5.
36.The different kinds of data can be grouped and named real time/on-line data, historical data or forecasts/schedules.
On-line data include measurements/analogue data, binary signals/status data (but might also include counters).
Historical data include measurement data (calculated values), counters and timers.
Schedules could be start/stop schedules for individual wind turbines.
38.Data are either polled at the node (the wind turbine) or periodic and automatic sent out from the node (periodic broadcast and event driven transfer). The important requirement is the 'scanning rate' (maximum delay).
39.Historical data, counter's and log's are transferred on demand (a request is sent to the wind turbine and the information is send back).
40.Alarm data shall be sent from the wind turbine on occurrence.
41.Setting data in the wind turbine and giving orders to the wind turbine are sent to the wind turbine when needed.
42.It should be possible to Time stamp all data. Time stamped data shall be stamped with 'last updated date + time' (UTC time). The accuracy and resolution of the timestamp should be at least 10 ms.
43.All analogue measured values should have readable properties like 'signal quality' and 'scanning rate'. This information does not have to be included with every data transfer. The averaging time and the measuring and averaging method should be documented for all data.
44.It should be possible to group both analogue and binary values so both can be read in a single transaction
45.Remote monitoring and operation of devices requires strict security measures for several reasons. To protect the data from being stolen, corrupted, and intentionally falsified, to protect the device from unauthorized use or to preserve the privacy of monitoring data.
46.To enforce these security requirements the following functionality is needed: Authentication, Data Integrity and Data Confidentiality.
47.Server authentication shall ensure the client application that authentication is truly operating on the intended site.
Client authentication ensures that an authorized client/operator is operating the equipment.
48.The rights for each user to operate functions and to see data on different levels in the object hierarchy might be necessary to set. In that way all users can have relevant access to the system and get updated information from the wind power plants.
49.Non-corruption of data transferred is necessary, the ability of a communication system to deliver data from a communication system originator to a communication system destination with an acceptable residual error rate. This prevents both malicious and false operation.
50.Data items transferred might need to be encrypted to prevent both malicious and false operation, as well as eavesdropping.
51.The response times of most operational functions and, therefore, of the related communication does not need to be much faster than one second (human time scale).
System management functions, which shall be available for the operators and control systems, are of low time critical nature. Delay in execution of System management functions, which shall be available for the operators and control systems however should not be more than 2 seconds.
Regarding safety of persons, plant and electric network, the communication system shall not be of critical nature. No functions regarding safety of persons shall be based on the communication system. No functions regarding safety of plant and electrical network shall be based on the communication system – all safety functions must be self-contained in the process or in the devices where systems interface and will trip automatically. In situations where the communication system is completely inaccessible, the plant may be forced to a shutdown by alternative means.
52.Regarding optimisation of the operation, the communication system has a major role.
The time critical functions include both control and supervision functions.
Set points for power control and Start and Stop commands are the most time critical functions, but also a prompt response (Acknowledge-on-receive) is important.
Periodic on-line operational data is essential for the optimisation of the operation.
Finally the operator need to know the status of the communication system to be able to rely on the presented data.
53.The time critical functions shall use short messages with a high priority. Data-wise the messages shall be small and shall be transmitted with a minimum of delay. Delays may occur due to transmission errors, low capacity or low bandwidth of the transport media or network faults. It is essential for the proper design of the communication system to select methods that minimise such properties.
54.Time critical functions must be based on fast and reliable transmission of a number of selected data types. An example of a typical requirement regarding delays for these data is as follows:'The overall transfer time for services in time critical functions shall not be more than 0,5 seconds.
55.Reliability in the sense that data can be retransmitted, reconstructed, or reprocessed if lost or inaccessible of some reason is essential. Data may be inaccessible because of faults in the process (plant), faults in data transport or faults in data processing units. For most data it must be possible to restore information, including the sequence of events. Local procedures for recovery may incorporate redundancy of selected functions and backup of data. The communication system shall include functionality to transfer stored data to central storage and processing after restoration of the communication.
56.To prevent interruptions in the data transfer, the communication system shall allow for redundant communication channels. Processing of data may be carried out simultaneously on more units. Automatic procedures for detection of communication faults and for managing redundancy of system components shall be established. The physical transport media should possibly be redundant to a certain degree depending on the conditions at the specific plant.
57.There must be a way for existing plants to interface to a new communication system. The expected solution to interface systems using proprietary methods for communication, manufacturer-specified protocols or customer-specified protocols, to new communication systems is to use gateways.
58.The interface to existing plants will provide a subset of the functions and data specified in this Specification. It should however as far as possible be able to present data on the same HMI and provide as many data as possible for the system databases.
