2.SSCM structure is considered as a prerequisite for a sustainable success. Thus designing an effective SCM structure provides competitive advantages for the companies. In order to achieve an effective design of this structure, it is possible to apply quality function deployment (QFD) approach which is successfully applied as an effective product and system development tool. This study presents a decision framework where analytic network process (ANP) integrated QFD and zero-one goal programming (ZOGP) models are used in order to determine the design requirements which are more effective in achieving a sustainable supply chain (SSC). The first phase of the QFD is the house of quality (HOQ) which transforms customer requirements into product design requirements.

5.For some years companies and environmental authorities have been increasing their awareness in incorporating environmental issues into their respective systems. Terms such as environmental design, sustainable design, environmentally- conscious processes or products, clean technologies, and green products or systems are now becoming widely important. As the environmental consciousness has become a fundamental design focus for both production and service systems, supply chains that combine manufacturing and service systems gained importance in environmental area. Recently, the first objective of a supply chain was to manage the ''better quality-low cost'' paradox and other requirements of stakeholders. However as an effect of the globalization quality and cost are no longer considered as competitive differences in supply chain management (SCM). Sustainable supply chain (SSC) on the other hand provides competitive advantages to the companies as it offers the opportunity to differentiate from other companies by being equitable in the fair utilization of natural resources, prudent enough not to harm the environment, being socially responsible in terms of equal human development, ensuring health and safety of employees and contributing to humanity and the environment.

6.Nowadays, it is not easy to achieve sustainability in a supply chain without considering budget limitations or the fact that a project may not be efficient or enough to achieve sustainability. To achieve sustainability effectively it is necessary to achieve improvements in economic, social and environmental area. Any project should take into account these three aspects of the sustainability and the investment cost. Designing a sustainable supply chain is a critical process which can lead a total failure when the time comes to apply. In addition to this any application in a particular point of a supply chain affects instantly the entire supply chain. That is why in order to decide what steps to take for a sustainable supply chain design; some decision methods must be used. Quality function deployment (QFD) as a well known method has a large application area within the sustainability framework, such as sustainable product development, improvement analysis and design process. In this study in order to design effectively a sustainable supply chain, QFD approach is used as it is a commonly used tool for environmentally conscious design process. Some of those studies in the literature are Madu, Kuei, and Madu, Sakao, Kuo, Wub, and Shieh. The first phase of the QFD is the house of quality (HOQ) which is the key strategic tool to determine the DRs that satisfy the CRs. Determining the relative importance of customer requirements (CRs) and design requirements (DRs) is an important step of the QFD. In order to determine their relative importance several methods are applied by many authors. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP), fuzzy set theory and analytic network process (ANP) are the frequently used methods. AHP combined QFD methodologies are used by many authors such as Lu, Madu, Kuei, and Winokur, Madu and Kuei, Madu, Kuei, Aheto, and Winokur, Park and Kim, Wang, Xie, and Goh, Lam and Zhao, Koksal and Eğitman, Zakarian and Kusiak, Partovi and Epperly, Partovi, Chuang, Partovi and Corredoira, Partovi, Hsiao,Kwong and Bai, Madu , Myint, Bhattacharya, Sarkar, and Mukherjee, Hanumaiah and Mukherjee, Partovi, Presley, Meade, and Sarkis, Çelik, Cebi, Kahraman, and Er, and Georgiou, Gotzamani, Andronikidis, and Paltayian. On the other hand as AHP includes an assumption about the independence among elements under a hierarchical structure, it does not consider the possible interrelationships among DRs and CRs. Thus the ANP method which takes into account the interrelationships among DRs and CRs is used in this study in order to obtain a well-built model as in many other studies like Karsak, Sozer, and Alptekin, Partovi, Lin, Cheng, Tseng, and Tsai, Partovi and Corredoira, Kahraman, Ertay, and Buyukozkan, Iranmanesh and Tabrizi, Lee, Wu, and Tzeng, Andronikidis, Georgiou, Gotzamani, and Kamvysi, Alptekin and Isiklar, Pal, Ravı, and Bhargava, Georgiou , and Buyukozkan, Ertay, Kahraman, and Ruan. In this paper, the methodology proposed integrates two decision making techniques, ANP and zero one goal programming for determining the DRs that will be considered in designing the sustainable supply chain. The ZOGP is used in order to determine the DRs to be considered in the design process satisfying the ANP results and the goal named "cost" in this study. zzzzThe plan of the article is as follows. In Section 2, definition of the sustainability concept and its appearance in supply chain is given. Section 3 announces the application areas of QFD in general and then presents literature survey of the sustainable QFD. Section 4 presents literature surveys of ANP combined QFD and integrated ANP&ZOGP combined QFD approaches. And then the decision methodology is given.

7.Earth as a resource system has a limited capacity for supporting a growing human population with an intensive exchange of materials and energy with its environment. #. Due to the media and academia, the potential long-term implications of overusing these resources are known better. In recent years, interest in environment preservation is increasing, and emerging as real business targets. As a result, many countries have started to enforce environmental legislations and regulations for controlling the use of products, processes and wastes that may be detrimental to the environment. The European Parliament views this concept of sustainability as so critical to the future of the EU that current and future legislation must integrate sustainability into implementation orders. Considering the earlier influence of the EU in the area of quality management and the global adoption of ISO 9001 certification, the influence of the EU about the sustainability can be estimated. At this point sustainability, generally defined as "using resources to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own", is acquiring importance for the public and for industry. Until 10 years ago, the unique aim of business was to achieve the maximum economic profit or to improve the customer service but now environmental topics play a very important role, becoming a central point of the strategic and operative management policies. There is a great awareness of sustainability and environmental responsibility in academia and business. The top global companies put headings such as ''Sustainability and Environment,'' ''Environmental Initiatives,'' ''Environmental Activities,'' or ''Environmental Leadership'' on the front pages of their websites and in recent years we have witnessed an abundance of calls for papers that bridge operations and environmental issues. Lately the number of companies who think that sustainability and profitability are not mutually exclusive concepts is increasing. Their common perspective is that the sustainability creates longterm shareholder value as it is an obligation for companies to meet the needs of their shareholders while sustaining the resources that will be needed in the future. The scarcity of raw materials such as fossil fuels and water, new regulations of governments and the global awareness about sustainability leads companies to develop sustainable strategies. These companies use various strategies and tools to assess their economic, social and environmental impacts associated with sustainability, such as environmental management systems, pollution prevention, waste minimization, design for environment and clean technology programs.

8.As the connection between markets and sources, demand and supply has increased the strategic relevance of SCM, in today's competitive world maintaining an efficient and flexible supply chain became critical for every enterprise. With the increasing acceptance of ISO 14001 environmental standards, there is a greater role for supply chain management in organizational environmental practice. In order to retain and strengthen their competitive edge in the market, organizations need to coordinate and integrate all their business operations with sustainability considerations. A focus on supply chain is a step towards the broader adoption and development of sustainability, since the supply chain considers the product from initial processing of raw materials to delivery  to the customer. However, sustainability also must integrate issues and flows that extend beyond the core of supply chain management: product design, manufacturing by-products, by-products produced during product use, product life extension, product end-of-life, and recovery processes at end-of-life. Sustainability involves the multiple objectives of social, economic and environmental sustainability. For social sustainability, products should ensure that the needs of population are met. For economic sustainability, the goal of supply chain optimization and scheduling is maximizing the profits,  maximizing products values with minimum raw materials, inventory and production costs. For resources sustainability, as for environmental sustainability, non-renewable resources consumption should be minimized, the resource use should be efficient to minimize wastes generated and permanent environmental damage should not be allowed. Integrating sustainability into the supply chain has several advantages. A SSCM reduces waste created and thereby realizes cost savings through the entire supply chain while increasing the revenue and the market share as the preference for sustainable organizations increases. In addition to this, sustainability helps to hire talented employees who pay attention to the organization's environmental behavior. On the other hand, it also increases the employee productivity and creates higher retention of most talented employees as it renders their work meaningful. Review, all these advantages mentioned in this section highly depend on design effectiveness due to the multi perspective structure of SSC. Another important issue about the design process of a SSC is that the sustainability it self is a novel concept in literature even tough the number of studies about the sustainability and the SSC increased recently. Design process is a critical step for establishing an effective SSC. On the other hand, QFD method is used in several studies to determine the design requirements of a product or service. As it is an effective technique used in many different studies, in this study QFD approach is utilized for determining how to build an effective sustainable supply chain design. This technique is presented later in this study.

9.Quality function deployment (QFD) is an implement to translate customer needs into product technical requirements of new products and services. The QFD was first introduced by Akao in 1972 at Mitsubishi's Kobe shipyard site, and then Toyota and its suppliers developed it further for a rust prevention study. It became increasingly popular in the Western world in the 1980s. After the concept of QFD was introduced in the US through auto manufacturers and parts suppliers, many US firms, such as Procter & Gamble, Raychem, Digital Equipment, HewlettPackard, AT&T, GM, and Ford, applied QFD to improving communication, product development, and measurement of processes and systems. It has been successfully applied in many organizations to improve processes and build competitive advantages. Being one of these quality tools, QFD has been defined by its originator Akao, 1992 as ''a method for developing a design quality aimed at satisfying the customer and then translating the customer's demands into design targets and major quality assurance points to be used throughout the production phase''. QFD can be defined as an overall concept that provides a means of translating the needs of customers through the various stages of product planning, engineering and manufacturing into a final product. Much variation of QFD has been extensively studied recently. It is reviewed in terms of application areas and methodological issues. According to Sharma  the functional field of QFD can be grouped in 3 categories, which are: (1) Primary functional field including QFD usage in product development, customer requirement analysis and quality management system. (2) Secondary functional field including QFD usage in concurrent engineering, management sciences, planning, operation research, education, software and expert systems (including artificial intelligence, artificial neural network and fuzzy logic). (3) Tertiary functional field including QFD's functions such as construction, cost, food, the environment and decisionmaking. QFD is applied in various areas which are mentioned previously. There exist numerous studies that combine QFD and the environmental concepts.

13.In this section, a literature survey about environmentally conscious and sustainable QFD applications is presented. Zhang, Wang, and Zhang improve the green QFD by developing a new methodology called green QFD II which combines Life cycle analysis (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) into QFD matrices and provides a mechanism to deploy customer, environmental and costing requirements throughout the entire product development process. Masui, Sakao, Kobayashi, and Inaba developed a QFD named quality function deployment for environment (QFDE) based on four-phase methodology for design for environment (DFE) in the early stage of new product development process. Reyes and Wright develop a four-phase methodology. In phase 1 and phase 2, eco profile strategies are defined and prioritized using AHP. In phase 3 and phase 4, ecoperformance strategies are identified and associated with eco profile strategies using QFD. Madu  present a step by step approach for environmentally conscious design. First, AHP is used to prioritize customer requirements. Then, QFD is used to match design requirements to customer requirements. A costeffective design plan is finally developed by applying Taguchi experimental design and Taguchi loss function. Bovea and Wang introduce an approach for identifying environmental improvement options by taking customer preferences into account. The LCA methodology is applied to evaluate the environmental profile of a product while a fuzzy approach based on the House of Quality in the QFD methodology provides a more quantitative method for evaluating the imprecision of the customer preferences. Sakao extends the Masui  by integrating LCA and theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ) into QFD. Sakao proposes a general design methodology to effectively support environmentally consciousness design of products using QFDE. Halog  search for the answer of how a given process or technique can be improved to qualify as an environmentally conscious one at a given budget constraint by using the QFD method for the improvement analysis. Kuo  develop an Eco-quality function deployment (Eco-QFD) to aid a product design team in considering environmental concerns. Beside from these studies focused on environmental aspect of the sustainability there are several studies focused on environmental, economic and social aspects of the sustainability where sustainable QFD (SQFD) is utilized. Lin  applies an ANP combined fuzzy QFD model where HOWs are environmental, social and economic production requirements and WHATs are sustainable production indicators for original equipment manufacturing. Halog proposes a methodology where the ''sustainable concept comparison house'' is used to evaluate the design options with respect to customer's quality requirements, environment requirements and economic requirements criteria and to choose the optimal sustainable option for system improvement. Utne applies QFD technique to improve sustainability in the Norwegian fishing fleet. Stakeholder needs of the fishing fleet are presented with respect to three aspects of sustainability (environmental, social and economic requirements) in the proposed QFD approach.

ANP generalizes the widely used multi-criteria decision making tool, the AHP, by replacing hierarchies with networks. The AHP is a well-known technique that decomposes a problem into several levels in such a way that they form a hierarchy. Each element in the hierarchy is supposed to be independent, and a relative ratio scale of measurement is derived from pairwise comparisons of the elements in a level of the hierarchy with respect to an element of the preceding level. However, in many cases, there is interdependence among criteria and alternatives. The ANP can be used as an effective tool in those cases where the interactions among the elements of a system form a network structure. Apart from AHP, the ANP has been used in conjunction with QFD in numerous studies. AHP employs a unidirectional hierarchical relationship among clusters, while ANP enables interrelationships not only among the clusters but also between the elements of a cluster. In this study an ANP combined QFD will be employed. A literature survey of the studies where ANP integrated QFD models were used, is given in  this section. Karsak  suggested product planning in QFD using a combined analytic network process and goal programming approach to determine the design requirements of a writing instrument. Partovi while combining AHP and QFD methods for quantifying strategic service vision used also ANP to determine the intensity of column variables. Similarly, Partovi used ANP combined QFD to quantify the relative importance of customer requirements in order to determine the best process for a new facility of a manufacturing system. Lin  applied QFD and ANP to analyze the environmental production requirements for original equipment manufacturing (OEM) firm in Taiwan. ANP was employed to represent the interdependence relations between ''Whats'' (environmental production requirements) and ''Hows'' (sustainable production indicators) which are two major components of the HOQ matrices. Partovi and Corredoira presented a QFD model where ANP was used for prioritizing and designing rule changes for the game of soccer in order to make it more attractive to soccer enthusiasts. Kahraman  presented a fuzzy ANP integrated QFD approach applied in a Turkish Company producing PVC window and door systems. Here, ANP was used to obtain the coefficients of the objective function.

16.As mentioned before, there are several analytic techniques combined with QFD in order to determine the relative importance weights of DRs such as AHP, fuzzy set theory, linear programming, ANP etc. ANP method considers the interrelationships among CRs and DRs and as in this study there are interdependences between DRs and CRs, ANP method is considered suitable for this study. On the other hand an effective design should take into account the organization's goal, thus the goal programming (GP) method is utilized in this study. There are several studies where these two techniques are used together or combined with QFD. Tsai, Hsu, Chen, Lin, and Chen, Tsai and Chou, Wey and Wu, Tsai, Leu, Liu, Lin, and Shaw, Chang, Wey, and Tseng, and Lee and Kim used in their studies ANP and GP techniques. As mentioned before ANP and GP combined QFD methodology is also used in several studies. Karsak  proposes such a methodology in order to determine the DRs to be considered in designing a product. Their paper presents a zero-one goal programming methodology that includes importance levels of DRs derived using the ANP and other goals. Kahraman  use a fuzzy ANP and GP combined QFD methodology to determine the DRs to be considered in designing a product. Tolga and Alptekin present an ANP and GP combined QFD methodology where the fuzzy set theory implemented ANP is used to incorporate the inner dependencies among the CRs and DRs of the QFD and the GP method in order to optimize the use of the limited budget of the product development process.

18.The decision algorithm addresses the problem of  determining the DRs on which to focus in the design process considering the   predetermined goals. The algorithm can be divided into two major phases. In the first  phase, we construct the HOQ using the ANP approach, and in the second phase, we  integrate the ANP results with a ZOGP model to determine the set of DRs to be  concentrated on. The ANP approach, which allows for modeling interrelationships within the HOQ, is employed to determine the representation of the voice of the customer in the HOQ, considered as one of the goals within the decision framework. There are other goals such as cost and feasibility that need to be taken into account in the analysis. The unit budget costs with respect to DRs are determined, and the priorities of the DRs with respect to feasibility goal are obtained using pairwise comparison. Following that, the adjusted priorities of the DRs with respect to this goal are calculated to account for dependencies encountered in the HOQ. Then, the relative importance weights of the goals that are taken into consideration are computed employing pairwise comparisons. Finally, all the previously calculated data are integrated within a ZOGP formulation to determine the DRs to be considered in the design process. A summary of the seven steps used in this study for ZOGP are as fallows: Identify the CRs and DRs. Considering the interdependencies within the house of quality, determine the overall priorities of the DRs using the ANP approach.

20.where w1 is a vector that represents the impact of the goal, namely achieving a supply chain that satisfies the company, on the customer requirements, W2 is a matrix that denotes the impact of the CRs on each of the DRs, W3 and W4 are the matrices that represent the inner dependence of the CRs and the inner dependence of the DRs, respectively. Here, 'impact' denotes the potential of the DRs to satisfy the requirements implicit in each of the customer requirements, and in a similar way for the customer requirements in terms of the goal. The network representation of the QFD model is depicted in 1. This is the case of a hierarchy with inner dependence within components and no feedback. Using the notation given above, the interdependent priorities of the customer requirements (wC) are computed by multiplying W3 by w1, and similarly the interdependent priorities of the DRs (WA) are obtained by multiplying W4 by W2. Then, the overall priorities of the DRs (WANP), which reflect the interrelationships within the HOQ, are calculated by multiplying WA and wC. In order to determine the set of DRs that will be considered in product design, we construct a ZOGP model using the first phase results and goals related to other metrics of the DRs such as cost, feasibility. The set of metrics contains two types of specifications: metrics that have some sort of resource limitations,  cost, and the second type metrics that result in a rate of preference for DRs such as feasibility. In order to incorporate the second type metrics into the formulation, we determine a preference rating for each DRs using pairwise comparisons, and we penalize the negative deviation of these metrics from 1 in the objective function, the general form of the ZOGP model employed in the decision framework is as follows:

HOQ contains in the body section a matrix which shows the relationship between CRs in rows and DRs in columns.

28.Develop a relationship matrix between CRs and DRs The purpose of building a HOQ is to compare the customer requirements and design requirements determining their respective degree of relationships. Tracing the relationships between the customer requirements and design requirements may be very confusing, because each customer requirement may affect more than one design requirement and vice versa. It is common to use symbols to represent the degree of relationship between the customer requirements and technical descriptors. The conventional HOQ employs a rating scale  1–3–9, or 1– 5–9 to indicate the degree (weak, medium or strong) of strength between CRs and DRs. In this study, numbers are used to denote the relationship between CRs and DRs.

37.The TBL implies that a company creates more value over the long run and encounters fewer risks if it takes into consideration the environmental (planet), social (people), and financial issues (profit) as compared to a company that focuses merely on the profit. This concept is also symbolized in literature by ''triple P'' which means planet, people, and profit. For social sustainability, products should ensure that the needs of population are met. For economic sustainability, the goal of supply chain optimization and scheduling is maximizing the profits,  maximizing products values with minimum raw materials, inventory and production costs. As for environmental sustainability, non-renewable resources consumption should be minimized, resource use should be efficient to minimize wastes generated and permanent environmental damage should not be allowed. When we deal with sustainable supply chain optimization of continuous process industries, all the three types of sustainability objectives mentioned above should be considered. CRs used in this study are determined trough several studies in the scope of sustainability. These CRs are also enriched by the opinions of an expert with SCM experience. Total cost, Economic Benefit, equity use and inventory management are selected as economic requirements, fuel usage, emissions, waste created as environmental requirements and health and security, laws and regulation as social requirements. The CRs mentioned in this section are shown in 4.

39.Energy sector is one of the important sectors for the sustainability applications. It is getting more important as the energy consumption increases and the energy resources decreases in the world. On the other hand economic problems and environmental problems like global warming influence energy companies to achieve sustainability. Thus, the energy sector is a suitable sector for SSCM studies.

40.Step 1. As mentioned before, the QFD product planning process begins with the determination of the CRs and then the DRs. In our model, there are nine CRs and forty DRs cited in detail in previous sections. Step 2. In this step, the relative importance of the CRs is determined by asking the following question: 'Which CR should be emphasized more in designing a sustainable supply chain (SSC), and how much more?' Assuming that there is no dependence among the CRs, the following eigenvector is obtained by performing pairwise comparisons with respect to the goal of achieving the best design.

41.Then, assuming that there is no dependence among the DRs, they are compared with respect to each CR. For example, one of the possible questions for determining the degree of relative importance of the DRs for inventory management can be as follows: 'What is the relative importance of DR9 (produce using minimum energy and materials) when compared to DR3 (optimized workflow with respect to total cost). yielding 2 as represented in Table 5. Then, for the remaining CRs the degree of relative importance of the DRs are calculated in the same way and presented in Table 6. The transpose of the data shown in Table 6 will be placed in the body of the HOQ.

42.Following that, the inner dependence among the CRs is determined through analyzing the impact of each CR on other CRs by using pairwise comparisons. The CRs which do not have an impact on economic benefit are not included in comparison matrix. A possible question is as follows: 'What is the relative importance of Total Cost when compared to Fuel Usage on achieving Economic Benefit?' resulting in 2 as denoted in Table 7. Then the eigenvectors obtained from pairwise comparisons are presented in Table 8. For the CRs that are independent the value assigned to the eigenvector weights is zero. Next, we deal with the dependence among the DRs. As previously accomplished for CRs, the inner dependencies are determined and required pairwise comparisons are performed. We utilize questions such as 'What is the relative importance of Labor education in subjects like technology use and process when compared to Integration of new technologies on controlling Effective use of accounting systems and management tools?', yielding 2 as shown in Table 9. The relative importance weights obtained from the pairwise comparisons are presented in Table 10. Afterwards, we obtain the interdependent priorities of the CRs as wC.

43-1. Then, the interdependent priorities of the DRs, WA, are calculated as follows: WA = W4 W2.
44.Following that, overall priorities of the DRs (WANP), reflecting the interrelationships within the HOQ, are obtained by multiplying WA and wC.

45.The ANP analysis results indicate that the most important design feature is the Labor education in subjects like technology use and process with a relative importance value of 81, which is followed by Integrating new technologies and Outsourcing which are slightly less important with a relative importance rate of 42 and 24, respectively. Step 3. This step enables us to include the goals related to resource limitations in the decision process. Cost budget is the only resource limitation for this example. It is a special case where a budget limit of 500$ is determined and the approximate cost of the possible projects to improve the current situation about each DR is shown in Table 11. Step 4. This step allows for taking into account additional goals named here as the second type metrics. However, in this example any second type metric is considered. Step 5. The weight vectors of DRs for cost budget, extendibility, and manufacturability metrics need to reflect dependencies among the DRs that are denoted in the roof of the HOQ. In order to incorporate the adjustment for dependencies, the inner dependence matrix of the DRs (W4) is multiplied with the unit cost vector of the DRs (c), resulting in the adjusted unit cost vector (C0) given below:
