1.Green computing refers to the practice of using computing resources more efficiently while maintaining or increasing overall performance. Sustainable IT services require the integration of green computing practices such as power management, virtualization, improving cooling technology, recycling, electronic waste disposal, and optimization of the IT infrastructure to meet sustainability requirements. Recent studies have shown that costs of power utilized by IT departments can approach 50% of the overall energy costs for an organization. While there is an expectation that green IT should lower costs and the firm's impact on the environment, there has been far less attention directed at understanding the strategic benefits of sustainable IT services in terms of the creation of customer value, business value and societal value. This paper provides a review of the literature on sustainable IT, key areas of focus, and identifies a core set of principles to guide sustainable IT service design.

2.Although the term 'green computing' and its alternative 'green IT' have recently become widely popular and taken on increased importance, their conceptual origin is almost two decades old. In 1991 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) introduced the Green Lights program to promote energy-efficient lighting. This was followed by the ENERGY STAR program in 1992, which established energyefficiency specifications for computers and monitors. However, it is in the last decade where green computing has gained traction. The rapid growth of Internet-based business computing, often metaphorically referred to as 'cloud' computing, and the costs of energy to run the IT infrastructure are the key drivers of green computing. Over the last several years the link between energy use and carbon generation and the desire to lessen both has given rise to the green computing label.

3.Dramatically increased energy use driven by the rapid expansion of data centers has increased IT costs, and the resulting environmental impact of IT, to new levels. Enterprise data centers can easily account for than 50 percent of a company's energy bill and approximately half of the corporate carbon footprint. In the U.S., the power consumption costs for data center computing and cooling doubled from 2000 to 2006 to $ billion. It expected to double again by 20011.

4.Although energy use and its associated cost has been the key driver for green computing, a growing appreciation of the risks of climate change and increasing concerns about energy security have elevated green computing to a national and global issue. In addition to corporate self interest, government regulations will increasingly drive the adoption of green computing and sustainable IT investment and practices. The new administration in the United States has stated intentions to endorse a 'green energy economy' which will likely cap carbon emissions; increase energy costs, and holds companies more accountable for their impact on the environment.

5.Due to the immediate impact on business value, it is likely that green computing will remain focused for some time on reducing costs while improving the performance of energyhungry data centers and desktop computers. However, it is not likely that this first wave of activity will fully extend to the general minimization of the ecological footprint of IT products and services for companies and their customers. Ecological issues involving IT product and service design, supply chain optimization, and changes in processes to deal with e-waste, pollution, usage of critical resources such as water, toxic materials, and the air shed will need to be more fully addressed. Although these first-wave activities are driven more by cost-reduction-based business value there is growing potential for green IT products and services being the deciding factor in terms of the intangible benefits of 'greenness' to the customer. Vendors are now able to position products and services in terms of energy consumption and lower costs, but the real benefit over time may be in positioning on environmental and social responsibility of the company itself.

6.'Sustainable IT' and especially 'sustainable IT services' are terms that are becoming synonymous with an emergent second wave of green computing innovation. Sustainable IT strategies are driving sustainability beyond just energy use and product considerations. This broader approach to corporate sustainability will necessitate the redesign of the IT organization and indeed the company itself if the strategic benefits of green computing are to be realized. This second wave will encompass the adoption of ecological strategies that will redefine markets, spur technological innovation, and lead to shifts in process, behavior and organizational culture that will integrate business models with environmental and social responsibility. These changes are being driven by the evolving changes in customer requirements from a sole emphasis on the tangible cost- benefit of reduced energy usage to increasingly intangible green benefits and cultural issues motivated by concerns for global warming and climate change.

7.For this paper, we define green computing as the practice of maximizing the efficient use of computing resources to minimize environmental impact. This includes the goals of controlling and reducing a product's environmental footprint by minimizing the use of hazardous materials, energy, water, and other scarce resources, as well as minimizing waste from manufacturing and throughout the supply chain. Green computing goals extend to the product's use over its lifecycle, and the recycling, reuse, and biodegradability of obsolete products. We define sustainable IT services1 in broader terms to include the impact of IT service strategies on the firm's and customers' societal bottom line to include economic, environmental, and social responsibility criteria for defining organizational success. Therefore, as defined, green computing practices inform a company's sustainable IT service strategies and process decisions.

9.Since its inception, the IT industry has focused on the development and deployment of IT equipment and services that was capable of meeting the ever-growing demands of business customers. Therefore, the emphasis has been on processing power and systems spending. Less attention was afforded to infrastructure issues which include energy consumption, cooling, and space for data centers, since they were assumed to be always available and affordable. Over the last decade these issues have become limiting factors in determining the feasibility of deploying new IT systems, while processing power is widely available and affordable.

10.Investment in data centers, including the energy cost for running and cooling them, is a major consideration for IT managers. A large enterprise data center cost from $500M to $1B, a three-fold increase since 2003. Data centers typically account for 25% of total corporate IT budgets and their costs are expected to continue to increase as the number of servers rise and the cost of electricity increases faster than revenues. One study indicated that the cost of running data centers is increasing 20% per year on average. With annual energy costs for computing and cooling nearly matching the costs for new equipment, data center expenses can squeeze out investment in new products, make data intensive products uneconomic, and squeeze overall margins. The quest for data center efficiency has be come a strategic issue.

14.The rapid growth of the Internet The increasing reliance on electronic data is driving the rapid growth in the size and number of data centers. This growth results from the rapid adoption of Internet communications and media, the computerization of business  processes and applications, legal requirements for retention of records, and disaster recovery. Internet usage is growing at more than 10 percent annually leading to an estimated 20% CAGR in data center demand. Video and music downloads, on-line gaming, social networks, e-commerce, and VoIP are key drivers. In addition, business use of the Internet has ramped up. Industries such as financial services (investment, banking, and insurance), real estate, healthcare, retailing, manufacturing, and transportation are using information technology for key business functions. The advent of the Sarbanes- Oxley Act with its requirement to retain electronic records has increased storage demand in some industries at 50 percent CAGR. Disaster recovery strategies that mandate duplicate records increases demand further. Finally, many federal, state, and local government agencies have adopted e-government strategies that utilize the Web for public information, reporting, transactions, homeland security, and scientific computing.

15.Increasing equipment power density Although advances in server CPUs have in some cases enabled higher performance with less power consumption per CPU, overall server power consumption has continued to increase as more servers are installed with higher performance power-hungry processors with more memory capacity. As more servers are installed they require more floor space. To pack more servers in the same footprint the form factor of servers has become much smaller, in some cases shrinking by more than 70% through the use of blade servers. This increase in packaging density has been matched by a major increase in the power density of data centers. Density has increased more than ten times from 300 watts per square foot in 1996 to over 4,000 watts per square foot in 2007, a trend that is expected to continue its upward spiral.

16.The increase in server power density has led to a concomitant increase in data center heat density. Servers require approximately 1 to  watts of cooling for each watt of power used. The ratio of cooling power to server power requirements will continue to increase as data center server densities increase.

For a typical $4,000 server rated at 500 watts, one study estimated it would consume approximately $4,000 of electricity for power and cooling over three years, at $8 per kilowatt-hour, and double that in Japan. The ratio of power and cooling expense to equipment expenses has increased from approximately  to 1 in 2000 to 1 to 1 in 2007. With the likely increase in the number of data centers and servers and the advent of a carbon cap-and-trade scheme, the cost of energy for data center power and cooling will continue to increase.

18.Restrictions on energy supply and access Companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo with the need for large data centers may not be able to find power at any price in major American cities. Therefore, they have built new data centers in the Pacific Northwest near the Columbia River where they have direct access to low-cost hydroelectric power and do not need to depend on the overtaxed electrical grid. In states such as, California, Illinois, and New York, the aging electrical infrastructure and high costs of  power can stall or stop the construction of new data centers and limit the operations of existing centers. In some crowded urban areas utility power feeds are at capacity and electricity is not available for new data centers at any price.

19.Data center efficiency is a major problem in terms of energy use. The server utilization rates average 5-10 per cent for large data centers. Low server utilization means that companies are overpaying for energy, maintenance, operations support, while only using a small percentage of computing capacity.

Their infrastructure equipment is reaching the end of its useful life. It is power hungry and inefficient. Such data centers typically use 2 or 3 times the amount of power overall as used for the IT equipment, mostly for cooling. The obvious strategy here has been to invest in new data centers that are designed to be energy efficient or to retrofit existing centers.

25.For example, microprocessor performance increased at approximately 50% CAGR from 1982 to 2002. However, performance increases per watt over the same period were modest. Energy use by servers continued to rise relatively proportionally with the increase in installed base. The shift to multiple cores and the development of dynamic frequency and voltage scaling technologies hold great promise for reducing energy use by servers. Multiple-core microprocessors run at slower clock speeds and lower voltages than single-core processors and can better leverage memory and other architectural components to run faster while consuming less energy.

26.Dynamic frequency and voltage scaling features enable microprocessor performance to ramp up or down to match workloads. Moving beyond microprocessors, the energy proportional computing concept takes advantage of the observation that servers consume relatively more energy at low levels of efficiency than at peak levels. Therefore, the goal is to design servers that consume energy in proportion to the work performed. Since microprocessors have more quickly acquired energy-saving capabilities, it is expected that CPUs will consume relatively less energy than other components. Therefore, it will be necessary for major improvements in memory, disk drives, and other components to reduce their power usage at higher levels of utilization.

28.Virtualization has become a primary strategy for addressing growing business computing needs. It is fundamentally about IT optimization in terms energy efficiency and cost reduction. It improves the utilization of existing IT resources while reducing energy use, capital spending and human resource cost. Data center virtualization affects four areas: server hardware and operating systems, storage, networks, and application infrastructure. For instance, virtualization enables increased server utilization by pooling applications on fewer servers. Through virtualization, data centers can support new applications while using less power, physical space, and labor. This method is especially useful for extending the life of older data centers with no space for expansion. Virtual servers use less power and have higher levels of efficiency than standalone servers.

29.Virtualization technology was originally developed by IBM (as CP/CMS in the 1960's) to increase the utilization efficiency of mainframes. More recently the concept has been applied to x86 servers in data centers. With the use of a hardware platform virtualization program called a hypervisor, or virtual machine monitor (VMM), multiple operating systems can run concurrently on a host computer. The hypervisor controls access to the server's processor and memory and enables a server to be segmented into several 'virtual machines', each with its own operating system and application. For large data centers, server usage ranges from 5-10 percent of capacity on average. With virtualization, server workloads can be increased to 50-85 percent where they can operate more energy efficiently. Less servers are needed which means smaller server footprints, lower cooling costs, less headcount, and improved manageability.

30.As Internet-based computing centralizes in the data center, software technology has advanced to enable applications to be used where and when needed. The term 'cloud computing' refers to a computing model that aims to make high-performance computing available to the masses over the Internet. Cloud computing enables developers to create, deploy, and run easily scalable services that are high performance, reliable, and free the user from location and infrastructure concerns. The 'cloud' has long been a metaphor for the Internet. When combined with 'computing' the definition turns to services.

31.As cloud computing continues to evolve it has increasingly taken on service characteristics. These services include utility computing, software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Utility computing. The first cloud services were developed by companies such as Amazon.com, Sun, and IBM that offered virtual servers and storage that can be accessed on demand. This is often described as an updated version of utility computing—essentially virtual computing capacity where users pay for what they use when they need it. Early adopters used this service for supplemental and non mission-critical needs. This model could be extended to include virtual data centers as a virtual resource pool.

45.While energy efficiency is the principal driver of green computing, environmental reporting standards will be the primary driver of sustainable IT services. Voluntary and global guidelines for sustainability reporting have existed for some time and are continuing to evolve. Over the next several years IT organizations will be asked by the business to support a comprehensive approach to sustainability. This will not only involve energy use, carbon emissions, and other environmental report; it will involve a comprehensive view of the entire value chain and corporate ecosystem. With IT at the core of business competitiveness, IT organizations will need to play a major role in the development of corporate sustainability strategy. With the ongoing shift to IT services, it makes business sense for IT organizations to look more holistically toward the development of sustainable IT services as the foundational element of the IT organization. We define sustainable IT services from a total societal value perspective as the aggregate value available to society from the systematic integration and alignment of the individual IT service components for the purpose of creating superior societal value. Therefore, all aspects of IT services must meet societal goals for sustainability while meeting customer and business value goals in terms of economic, environmental, and social responsibility requirements.

46.Business value is the overall benefit for business units and the enterprise as a whole that results from IT solutions or services. Business value is evidenced by increases in revenue or market position that derive from meeting customer requirements, providing customer savings or ROI, and making investments in innovation that advance the industry as a whole. Although this definition does recognize the customer and the industry at large, the overall focus of business value is to provide returns to the company. As such, business value often focuses on short-term, cost-based solutions that can overlook the long-term best interests of the customer, society, and resultantly, the business as well. The first wave focus on green computing, with its primary emphasis on cutting energy costs, can certainly increase business value, while increasing customer and societal value (carbon reductions). However, the short-term focus on costs cannot ensure that benefits to the customer and society will continue to be realized over the long term. A sole focus on creating business value is not sufficient for a sustainable IT services orientation.

48.Customer value is the overall benefit derived from a product or service, as the customer perceives it, at the price the customer is willing to pay. A focus on customer value requirements forces companies to look to the markets and the customer as the core drivers of business activity. With this external focus, customer value is a broader concept than the mostly inward looking business value. IT service providers must first understand how their customers perceive value in terms of the perceived benefits perceived and the perceived price of the service that delivers those benefits. It is necessary to understand what these tradeoffs are and how they might influence service configurations that can maximize customer value and business outcomes. The power of choice will ensure that those configurations that deliver superior value will also achieve superior business value. However, a short-term focus on customer value, which is the default approach given short product lifecycles and competitive pressures, is not sufficient for a sustainable IT services orientation. Some customers are willing to look at their long-term needs in a societal context, but for most consumers cost and performance are the dominant drivers.

49.The concept of societal value holds that companies should meet their market goals in such a way that enhances the customer's and the society's long-term well being. In that way, customer value and business value will be maximized as well. Societal value calls upon organizations to build ethical, social responsibility, and environmental considerations into their business practices. Therefore, companies must balance profits, customer requirements, and social responsibility in their business models. These goals are often in conflict and successful sustainable IT strategies should provide a roadmap for their alignment.

50.Although the need for the development of strategies to address the environmental sustainability of IT services has been apparent for many years, there is no extant body of literature on strategies or best practices. The issues surrounding the first wave of green computing are clearer and focused on reducing energy costs through new data center designs, architectures, facility and server density, and virtualization. Beyond that, companies are approaching sustainability through a fragmented incremental 'greener IT' approach. When developing IT services, few IT organizations consider the full environmental impact of their product and service designs. One reason for this is the short-term orientation that puts emphasis on costs and business value. If reducing costs also has a beneficial environmental impact, such as the relationship between reducing power costs and carbon emissions; that will be given priority. However, organizationally, it is unlikely the IT organization itself can drive the sustainability priorities of other departments without the full support of top management. An integrated corporatewide sustainability strategy is necessary for IT services to be truly sustainable. Then, it is possible for IT, facilities, supply chain management, manufacturing, finance, and marketing to all be acting in an integrated fashion.

51.Cost optimization was the primary emphasis of the first wave of green computing. Problems and solutions associated with green computing are well known. The second wave, which we call sustainable IT, or more appropriately, sustainable IT services, has a much broader focus on the role of IT in the society. The primary driver of sustainable IT is corporate social responsibility (CSR), especially as it applies to firm's impact on the economy, environment, and society at large. These are three areas of responsibility are associated with 'triple bottom line' or TBL reporting. The key tenet of corporate citizenship recognizes that an organization should ensure that its organizational objectives are in consonance with economic, environmental, and social goals of key stakeholders.

52.Few companies have developed a sustainable IT strategy that rises to an enterprise-level or focuses on social responsibility goals. Although organizations are changing their policies and practices to minimize their environmental impact, such efforts are generally not well organized or integrated. Many environmental projects have been undertaken due to customer safety concerns, legal action, legislation, regulation, community pressure, and to protect the brand. A sustainable strategy should be one that is complementary to both the business and the environment. The following topics should be considered for developing a strategy for sustainable IT services.

Product and service design should take the following factors into account: Clean technology. 'Cleantech' is new technology that addresses environmental problems. It differs from'greentech'in that it is not "end-of-pipe" clean up technology. Instead, cleantech addresses the roots of ecological problems with new science. Cleantech segments include green energy (generation, storage, infrastructure, and efficiency), transportation, water and wastewater, air and environment, materials, smart manufacturing, agriculture, recycling, and waste (www.cleantech.com).

62.Engagement with stakeholders is essential for an effective sustainability strategy. Information transparency provides customers, employees, business partners, investors, community members, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and the government with a report card on how the company is doing with its sustainability commitments. It is through continuing engagement with stakeholders that this  information helps form long-term relationships. These trust-based relationships informed by good public relations and customer satisfaction can build superior brand power. Increasingly, public companies have embraced triple bottom line (TBL or 3BL) reporting that expands the financial reporting requirements to include ecological and social performance in addition to accounting results. Although CSR reporting measures do not directly reflect on IT sustainability, the obverse is not true. Sustainable IT strategies, which are increasingly the backbone to all business processes, can have a dramatic impact on overall corporate sustainability results.

70.Sustainable IT has been a major focus for IT organizations for the past decade as the cost of power for data centers has risen rapidly. The focus of the first wave of sustainable IT initiatives has been on strategies to increase data center efficiency. Therefore, infrastructure, power and workload management, thermal management, product design, virtualization, and cloud computing strategies have assumed primacy in terms of both strategic and tactical focus. The second wave of sustainable IT services is nascent and much more difficult to define and implement. It involves defining the role of the IT organization in an enterprise's overall CSR strategy. It will involve establishing a roadmap and baseline metrics, redesigning business processes, encouraging participation, and adapting the organization's culture to new ways of doing things. IT governance and decision making will likely be substantially impacted. This paper offered a review of current thinking and suggested factors that should be considered for a sustainable IT strategy. Future research should address the relationship between customer value, business value, and societal value and how sustainable IT strategies will impact each. It would seem that these concepts should be mutually supportive.
