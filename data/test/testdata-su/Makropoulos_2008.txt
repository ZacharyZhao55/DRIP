1.	Conventional urban water management practices aim to meet water supply-demands while conveying wastewater and stormwater away from urban settings. Alternative approaches which consider water demands to be manageable and wastewater and stormwater as valuable resources, although being increasingly sought, lack reliable site specific implementation methodologies. This paper describes the development of a decision support tool (termed the Urban Water Optioneering Tool (UWOT)) to facilitate the selection of combinations of water saving strategies and technologies and to support the delivery of integrated, sustainable water management for new developments. The tool is based on a water balance model which allows the investigation of interactions between the major urban water cycle streams. The model is informed by a knowledge library which is populated with technological options and information on their major characteristics and performance. The technology selection is driven by a GA algorithm allowing efficient exploration of the decision space. Quantitative and qualitative sustainability criteria and indicators are used to compare between alternative composite water management strategies while preserving the multiobjective nature of the problem. The tool has been successfully tested on a case study site in the UK, and the results are presented and discussed. It is suggested that optioneeringtools will increasingly become part of urban water management planning toolkits as practice moves towards more decentralised, integrated, context-specific solutions to address issues of sustainability.

2.	Demographic change (including internal and international migration) and economic growth considerations are influencing much of the urbanisation processes, both in Europe and elsewhere. This has significant implications for current UK policy, with the Office of Deputy Prime Minister, predicting the need for over 4 million new households by 2016. This concentration of human activities intensifies local competition for all types of resource, with water amongst the most vital, rendering it increasingly difficult to find and utilize new sources of water necessary to satisfy growing water demand. It is argued that water management solutions for new residential developments should be based on sustainability considerations due to their far reaching social, economic and environmental implications. The application of sustainable practices within the urban environment is dependent on a number of development-specfic characteristics requiring both quantitative and qualitative information to be fully taken into account. This necessitates the development of appropriate decision support tools to help decision-makers to confront the ill-structured nature of the sustainability assessment process, examine its components and their interactions, allow for explicit statement of assumptions and enhance the communication between stakeholders, including researchers. Within this work the classic view of Sprague and Carlson was adopted, according to which the role of a DST is to support rather than replace managerial judgment, while assisting decision makers to explore possible solutions and outcomes beyond the obvious ones. The work presented here has been developed within the Water Cycle Management for New Developments (WaND) Project in the UK whose aim is ‘to provide guidelines and decision support tools for the implementation and assessment of efficient and sustainable water management interventions in new urban developments with due consideration to social, environmental and health associated factors’. The paper presents the background, development and application of a decision support tool, termed the Urban Water Optioneering Tool (UWOT) designed to facilitate the strategic planning of sustainable water management systems, and is structured as follows: the first section deals with sustainability objectives and the use of sustainability indicators as a means of supporting sustainable option selection. The following section deals with the urban water cycle, its distinct components and provides examples of urban water management (UWM) technologies, included in the tool. The third section describes in detail the generic structure of the water mass balance model, developed in Simulink, which forms the core of the DST as well as the Technology Library which contains the different technological options for UWM and their key characteristics. The implementation of a genetic algorithm driving the optimisation process embedded in the tool is then described and the results of the application of UWOT in a new residential development are presented and discussed. The paper concludes by discussing the main strengths of the tool and its potential role in the urban water management domain. Water management in new residential developments is tasked with the requirement to achieve acceptable levels of service, not overburden existing infrastructure, have minimal impacts on the natural environment and to be, at the same time, socially and economically acceptable. In turn, the whole of the urban water management cycle forms part of the broader water resources management cycle, currently influenced by (in essence) sustainability requirements embedded in environmental legislation in the EU. The emerging EU environmental legislation paradigm internalises principles of integrated water management, pollution prevention and a more complete concept of sustainability which, as stated by Brunner and Starkl, not only features ecological or economic aspects, but also social and institutional ones, such as the participation of stakeholders.

3.	The incorporation of sustainability assessment into decisio nmaking processes is thus becoming a key task for water service providers – in the UK and elsewhere. Quantifying or operationalising sustainability is, more often than not, a debatable concept and an ambiguous process to be handled with considerable attention to the particular characteristics of the problem at hand. The approach adopted here is the selection of appropriate criteria linked to specific indicators. The assessment of sustainability through the use of sustainability indicators is a well established and documented approach, including, but not restricted to work within the Sustainable Water industry Asset Resource Decisions (SWARD) project, the study by the International Hydrological Programme together with the American Society of Civil Engineers, or the work of Balkema in the Netherlands.

4.	A criterion can be defined as a measure against which option performance is assessed along with the degree to which stated objectives are achieved. Indicators constitute a means of measuring the level to which criteria are satisfied. The criteria-indicators approach adopted in this work, relates to the framework developed within the SWARD project which focuses on sustainability for the water industry. Following the classification introduced in SWARD, four Sustainability Capitals are being used, namely, environmental, economic, social and technical. Each capital contains a set of (quantitative or qualitative) indicators enabling assessment. A subset of the SWARD indicators was chosen and implemented in this study, based on their relevance to the scope of UWOT and the extent to which they could be satisfactorily quantified. This does not imply that other (nonquantifiable) indicators should be ignored, but only that such indicators cannot, by definition, be used in a quantitative tool such as UWOT and need to be assessed, within the decision-making process, in addition to UWOT’s results. The criteria and indicators adopted in this study are discussed in brief in the following section and are summarised in Table 1. For detailed definitions of these criteria and indicators the reader is referred to output from the SWARD Project. The methodology developed in this study, supported by the prototype UWOT software, deals with a specific type of urban water management problem: the (technological) option selection problem. It relates to the decision problem of choosing the most suitable technology given case-specific conditions and constraints with respect to technical, environmental, social and economic objectives. The three main components of the urban water cycle are water supply, wastewater disposal and stormwater drainage, making up the urban water system. The traditional approach is to consider the infrastructure that delivers potable water, separately from the infrastructure that disposes of wastewater and separately to the provision of drainage for stormwater. There is growing need to reevaluate this approach in order to seek ways to, inter alia, minimise the environmental impact of urban areas on supply sources and receiving waters. This necessitates the investigation and subsequent exploitation of possible interactions between the three main components of urban water. Until recently wastewater and rainwater were considered waste streams that needed to be conveyed away from the urban environment and disposed of. However, they are increasingly being seen as resources that need to be exploited rather than unavoidable by-products of urbanisation. Planning and operating the systems separately, foregoes the potential for utilisation of urban stormwater and wastewater for beneficial purposes, and disregards the fact that these systems are inter-connected and inter-related. Changing one flow can induce a reaction in the other systems. Potable water demand, for example, is directly related to wastewater production. Technologies that reduce water demand would influence wastewater conveyance systems. Another obvious example would be that water recycling techniques, apart from reducing water demand also reduce demand for sewage and sewage treatment. There emerges therefore, a need to take a more holistic view, allowing water supply, wastewater disposal, and stormwater drainage to be considered as interacting components within a single system. An integrated modelling framework is required, in order to investigate and quantify the interactions and transformations of the three water flows and to identify the future possibilities and the limitations of different systems within the context of sustainable water management for new developments. Prior to describing the structure of the UWOT prototype developed to address this need and analysing the functionality of its various components, a brief overview of five streams of urban water, that are distinguished by UWOT, is provided. These are: potable (or whitewater), greywater, treated greywater (or greenwater), wastewater (or blackwater) and runoff. Note that these do not correspond necessarily to the three urban water components (water supply, wastewater disposal and stormwater drainage) discussed above as they are introduced explicitly to allow for the conceptualisation of interactions between these components.

5.	Potable water is by definition water whose quality meets drinking water standards. Treating water to potable standards is an expensive and energy consuming process. However, as can be seen from 1, only a small proportion of in- house water demand is actually used for purposes requiring drinking water quality. Water consumption patterns can vary significantly from house to house, depending on the household occupancy, the social and cultural conditions as well as on the type of the water consuming appliances installed in the houses. Greywater is the dilute wastewater stream originating from domestic activities such as showering, bathing, washing hands, tooth brushing, dishwashing, washing clothes, cleaning and food preparation. The water contains some organic material, for example, food remains, with pathogens, and inorganic material, such as detergents, sand and salt. The advantage of reusing greywater is that the supply is regular and not dependent on external phenomena (such as rain). As a result, the storage space required could be substantially smaller than in the case of rainwater systems. Moreover, the substitution of potable water with greywater used for purposes other than drinking,, toilet flushing and garden irrigation, reduces demand and thus assists the preservation of valuable water resources. The main issues, relevant to the applicability of greywater systems include social acceptability and water quality. A freshly produced greywater usually does not have any objectionable odour. However, it requires early treatment after collection. If stored untreated for long periods, oxygen deficient conditions will develop and scum will be formed that can float or sink in the collection tank. Moreover, the bacterial population tends to increase with increased storage duration. In general, treating greywater prior to recycling is more socially acceptable, and renders it suitable for more uses. It should be noted, however, that water quality standards for in-house greywater use (or indeed greenwater – see below) have yet to be defined in the UK.

6.	Greenwater is a term used in this work to denote treated rainwater and treated greywater. Rainwater usually carries small pollutant loads (depended inter alia on location, roof building materials and collection system construction) and its harvesting system consists of three basic elements: the collection system, the conveyance system and the storage system. The main disadvantage is the unpredictable and often irregular supply which results in large storage space requirements. Light treatment and disinfection is generally adequate for rainwater treatment to nonpotable standards. Greywater requires more treatment than rainwater to reach an acceptable standard. The level of treatment required depends on the scale and purpose of use. At small scale, a two-stage treatment consisting of filtration of coarse pollutants (hair and suspended impurities) followed by disinfection with chlorine, bromine or UV may be sufficient. Greywater recycling at medium to large scales may be more viable but requires more complex treatment. Options include biological aerated filters, membranes, bioreactors, UV treatment, Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) dosing, membrane aeration bioreactors and coagulation/flocculation with alum or ferric.

7.	Greenwater, regardless of the scale of the recycling scheme or origin, could be a viable alternative water supply, and can potentially substitute potable water in some water uses within the house, with the obvious exception of drinking water or food preparation. Studies have shown that service (green) water made available from rainwater or greywater systems can be cost effective and with proper operation presents no hygienic risk or comfort loss for the consumer. The unavailability of water quality standards for greenwater in-house use, however, is an obvious barrier to its adoption as an alternative form of supply, at least in the UK. In conventional water supply and drainage systems, the whole volume of delivered drinking water becomes wastewater requiring treatment before being released to the environment. Increasing water demand also means that additional wastewater will have to be disposed of, often in areas where existing sewage treatment works may be at capacity or in areas where discharge potential to local watercourse is limited by environmental concerns. If recycling schemes are implemented the volume of wastewater produced can be significantly reduced. Within UWOT, greywater is considered separate from wastewater, the latter only used to describe water from the toilet that leaves the household water cycle to be treated at a central scale. However, if a no recycling setup is modelled within UWOT, then the greywater is added to the wastewater (blackwater) stream. New developments have a direct impact on existing drainage infrastructure and the surrounding environment. They increase the area of paved surfaces, thus reducing infiltration, while causing surface runoff to exhibit higher peak flows, larger volumes, shorter times to peak and accelerated transport of pollutants and sediment from urban areas.. This results in pollution of the receiving watercourses and increased flood risk within the development. Controlling surface runoff thus becomes a key element in working towards urban sustainability. Surface runoff can be reduced either by collecting rainwater for recycling (through harvesting1) – with the additional advantage of the reduced potable water demand – or by the installation of non-piped solutions to urban drainage (known as sustainable drainage systems (SUDS) in the UK). UWOT follows from extensive research carried out by the authors in sustainable urban water management, decision-making and computer modelling. A previous attempt towards the development of a tool with similar functionality – but of different structure and rationale – was carried out by Sakellari, within the framework of the WaND initiative. At that stage issues of modularity and upgradeability were identified as areas of improvement and UWOT was developed with an aim to maximise the potential of the system to be upgraded and improved upon in the future, without significant re- programming effort requirements. Although this modularity imposes a greater work load at the beginning of the programming process, UWOT followed the Argent and Grayson paradigm in assuming that the availability of an initial system to react to future needs and be improved upon, may actually overcome the users’ initial difficulties to interact with the system and thus increase its usefulness.The initial idea during the planning stage of UWOT was to develop it based on simple and commonly used software platforms, such as Microsoft Excel, which is widely available and familiar to most professionals in the field. However, spreadsheets have limitations, the most serious of which being their inability to handle complex decision-making algorithms, their computational imprecision and their limited database management capability. Liu and colleagues, suggest that computational capacity and sophistication can be readily added to a spreadsheet by linking it to one of the less widely available, but well known, high-level technical computing environments such as MATLAB by Mathworks. The development environment selected for the water mass balance model, which constitutes the core of UWOT, is Simulink, which forms part of the MATLAB suite of tools developed by Mathworks. Simulink enables the modelling, simulation, and analysis of dynamic systems, whose outputs change over time. Simulink was chosen as it facilitates the representation of processes and flows in a visually intuitive manner. UWOT integrates Simulink/MATLAB and Microsoft Excel (via Excel’s Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming environment) into a computationally strong and user-friendly decision support tool. Excel is used for data input, storage of technology options characteristics and results visualisation. MATLAB/ Simulink computes the water mass balance model, for the particular combination of technological options selected for evaluation by the user and processes its outputs in a form suitable for sustainability assessment, optimisation and visualisation, finally presented in Excel. The details of the mass balance model and its interaction with the technology options at different spatial and temporal scales are presented below. One of the main research and policy questions in the field of UWM today, at least in the UK is whether it is possible to attain more sustainable urban water management through improving the existing centralised systems or whether it is necessary to switch to new decentralised systems or is there an optimal mix of decentralised and centralised management that can combine the advantages of both systems, depending on the situation at hand. UWOT was designed to enable the comparison of a wide variety of water management technologies and schemes (including recycling, treatment and drainage) at different scales. Within the urban water cycle, water quantities are continuously exchanged between spatial scales in the form of potable water supply and generated wastewater, while, within the household, water is used to satisfy various types of demand. The appropriate spatial resolution for modelling the urban water cycle, is therefore an integration of distinct spatial layers that simulate the different scales, which, when combined, form the totality of the urban water development. In UWOT the most detailed level of modelling is the in-house micro- component, followed by the household and finally, the development level.

7-27. The details of the mass balance model and its interaction with the technology options at different spatial and temporal scales are presented below.
7-28. One of the main research and policy questions in the field of UWM today, at least in the UK is whether it is possible to attain more sustainable urban water management through improving the existing centralised systems or whether it is necessary to switch to new decentralised systems or is there an optimal mix of decentralised and centralised management that can combine the advantages of both systems, depending on the situation at hand. #relationship:0# 7-29. UWOT was designed to enable the comparison of a wide variety of water management technologies and schemes (including recycling, treatment and drainage) at different scales.
7-30. Within the urban water cycle, water quantities are continuously exchanged between spatial scales in the form of potable water supply and generated wastewater, while, within the household, water is used to satisfy various types of demand. #relationship:A# 7-31. The appropriate spatial resolution for modelling the urban water cycle, is therefore an integration of distinct spatial layers that simulate the different scales, which, when combined, form the totality of the urban water development.
7-32. In UWOT the most detailed level of modelling is the in-house micro- component, followed by the household and finally, the development level.
8.	The micro-component represents a single water using appliance, for example, a washing machine, a shower, or a household scale greywater treatment system. Modelling separately all appliances that use water, is fundamental to the modelling concept of UWOT, since each appliance is considered a technological option (either selected by the user or proposed by the optimisation algorithm) with specific characteristics affecting both the water cycle and the subsequent sustainability assessment. All micro-component options are contained, as suggested before in a library which includes multiple technological options for each water use within the household (e.g. multiple types of washing machines, each with specific characteristics). The next modelling scale is the household which represents a single building, which can have private, commercial or public function. The household represents an aggregation of the micro-components it contains. The UWOT prototype developed can model six types of households depending on the specific configuration of appliances and user practices (e.g. frequency of use) within them. Inputs to the household are (a) rainfall falling on the impervious and pervious areas of the plot,(b) potable water from the water service provider (WSP) and treated greenwater water if a centralised recycling scheme is installed. The basic outputs of this scale are wastewater and runoff. In the case of centralised recycling schemes, greywater and/or harvested rainwater are also exchanged between the household and the development scales. The development represents a group of households, possibly of different types, as well as the associated roads and public open space. It is the spatial scale at which centralised treatment and recycling schemes, as well as centralised SUDS. The water balance model inputs at this level are rainfall and potable water from the WSP while the only outputs are runoff and wastewater produced. Water evaporated or infiltrated at the development scale, constituting a sink in the water balance at this scale, is calculated and subtracted from the water balance but not modelled in detail. In terms of spatial variability, the UWOT prototype assumes uniformity within the development and does not attempt to model physical processes. Spatial variability is represented by exploiting the multiple household type functionality and the associated differences in characteristics that can be assigned to these types by the user (including percent of impervious cover etc). The most spatially dependant inputs to the model are the rainfall data (in the form of time-step-average rainfall) and the evapotranspiration potential. Since the model is run at large time-steps, no account is taken of the hydraulics of flows within and between households. The scope of UWOT is to facilitate the strategic planning and preliminary design of sustainable water management systems, rather than to provide support for detailed design and implementation of the technologies. A daily time-step was therefore selected as appropriate for the water balance model. This level of aggregation results in the loss of diurnal variations in flows, but was considered adequate to provide sufficient information for the comparison of different water management strategies and technologies especially for long-term simulations, necessary for sustainability assessment. UWOT aims to facilitate the comparison of different water management technologies and their combination at different application scales. In order to achieve this aim, a knowledge base of existing water management technologies was developed and populated. This knowledge base, termed Technology Library was implemented in multiple Excel spreadsheets, one for each category of technological option (e.g. baths, showers, greywater treatment systems etc) and contains data and information on their major characteristics and performance. The information included in the library is based on the environmental, economic, social and technical indicators introduced in earlier sections. Some of these indicators are quantitative (e.g. installation costs for a particular tap) while others are qualitative and require input in the form of judgement for the particular situation for which the tool is used (e.g. social acceptability of a particular greywater recycling scheme in a particular development). This judgement can be generated by domain experts, or (more appropriately) by stakeholder engagement and consultation. The process of generating context-specific indicators for specific technologies at a case-by-case basis does not fall within the subject matter of this paper. It is acknowledged that this is not a straightforward process, but it is important to stress that the tool is flexible enough to ignore any indicators for which such information is unavailable, unreliable or irrelevant. Apart from the sustainability indicators, the technology library also contains operational parameters, including technical and operational characteristics for each technology that are necessary for the calculation of the water balance for the total modelled urban water cycle whenever a specific technology is selected for use (e.g. water use per flush for a specific type of toilet). The technology library currently comprises 14 separate spreadsheets. Table 2 presents the different technology categories and classifies them into different application scales. Each technology spreadsheet includes information on a series of technologies of the same technology type. The Simulink water balance model is at the core of UWOT and was created to investigate the effect of selecting different combinations of technologies (at various scales) on the water cycle of the development. The Simulink model consists of distinct, (drag-ndrop) components. This is facilitated by the Simulink modelling units called blocks. By developing and linking together various independent blocks, a powerful yet modular application has been built minimising the effort required for future model extension. In Simulink, a block is an independent unit (an object) which can simulate a process by calculating a set of internal and/or external functions, including MATLAB M-files or Simulink S-files. For the water cycle at the household scale, the elements of the system, such as a water source (e.g. water supplied from external WSPs), water use appliances (e.g. washing machine, toilet and shower) and treatment units (e.g. local greywater recycling system) are all viewed as objects that encapsulate specific attributes and behaviours and can interact with other objects by exchanging water quantity and quality information. These objects are used to model the components of the water cycle. A schematic representation of an example configuration for a household block can be seen in 4 to assist in the visualisation of the model description. The figure illustrates the basic idea of the modelling components presented in the discussion below, but does not represent the detailed configuration of the Simulink blocks developed for UWOT. For the purposes of model construction, components are distinguished into sources, appliances and sinks. Sources are the elements thatbringwater into the system, such as an (external) potable water supply component or a rainwater collection tank. Appliances are all elements that usewater (e.g. a washing machine). Finally, sinks are the elements that convey water out of the system, such as a wastewater conveyance system. Several blocks can be grouped according to their functionality to form a new composite block. UWOT uses this functionality to manage the different scales within the urban water cycle. Below, the composite blocks employed in UWOT are presented from a model development perspective to facilitate understanding of how the model is constructed. The household block, which can represent any type of building, is created by aggregating several components and modelling their dynamic interactions. The block is divided into four subsystems: source, allocation, water use and switches/multipliers. The source subsystem handles the integration of the water source components. The output from the source subsystem represents the total water available in the house separated into water quality volumes (white, green, grey and black) and is (re)calculated at each timestep. The water use subsystem contains appliance components and it is here that the demand for water is generated. The allocation subsystem matches supply and demand for different water qualities based on user-defined preferences and water quality priorities. This is probably the most complex subsystem and will be presented in greater detail in the following paragraphs. The switches/multipliers subsystem defines the existence (or not) of recycling schemes for greywater and rainwater harvesting, and is operated on the basis of either user input or optimisation. The source subsystem is composed of three water sources (white, green and greywater) that are modelled as water tanks, with a fixed storage capacity and a variable water level. The green and the greywater tanks represent the actual storage tanks that are installed in the house to balance supply and demand. The potable water tank on the other hand is conceptual and is included for reasons of symmetry of representation and used to model (external) potable water supply from the WSP. In principle this could also be set to some fixed capacity to model water scarcity or rationing, but in the current development stage it has been assigned an infinite storage capacity. A crucial issue in modelling the water cycle within the household is the balance between demand for water and its provision.

8-59. A crucial issue in modelling the water cycle within the household is the balance between demand for water and its provision.
9.	This includes the allocation of water by the tanks to competing water requests and the prioritisation of water uptake by the appliances between alternative water sources. In UWOT, each micro-component is associated with a list of different water qualities that the micro- component can receive in order of (user-defined) preference. A toilet, for example, may be specified to prefer to use greenwater and only if this is not available to accept potable water for flushing. The tanks on the other hand, supply water using a first come, first serve basis. Since in the Simulink mass balance model all requests would happen simultaneously within one time- step, the randomness of the actual phenomenon3 is simulated by creating a random water request sequence. Clearly dependencies between appliances could also be built into this random sequence but this has not been implemented in this version of the UWOT prototype. The appliances subsystem contains all the water components and generates the demand. This is where water quality is altered based on its use. For example, in the toilet components, water input is transformed to blackwater irrespective of the quality of the input. The shower components transform all input to greywater, and in the treatment components, greywater is transformed to greenwater. The switches subsystem manages rainwater harvesting (to be used as a source for greenwater) and greywater recycling. It is responsible for diverting the appropriate water streams according to user preferences. The switches can be set (by the user) to 0, 1 or 2 for no recycling, local recycling and centralised recycling, respectively. If the rainwater harvesting switch is set to 0, for example, then the rainwater stream will be connected directly to the runoff stream and flow out of the development. If it is set to 1 the rainwater stream will be harvested within the household, and if it set to 2, the rainwater stream will be diverted to a centralised rainwater treatment facility. The same applies to the greywater streams. The development scale is created by an aggregation of households. Six different types of household (composite) blocks are supported in the current version of the model and can be used to represent different types of premises with different occupancy and water use. Additional components at this scale are roads and public open space associated with the development, centralised rainwater and greywater treatment facilities and service reservoirs for the greenwater water resulting from these facilities. A schematic representation of the concept can be seen in 5. Sources of water at this scale are the potable water supplied by the WSP and rainfall, while the sinks represented are wastewater and runoff leaving the development, as well as water that is infiltrated or evaporated. Efforts were devoted to designing a user-friendly interface, motivated by the fact that user-friendly interfaces have been reported to help overcome, at least partly, some stakeholder’s reluctance towards use of formal decision support systems. The design of the user interface for UWOT considered issues of accessibility, flexibility, and interactiveness, as discussed in Malczewski. In particular, the interaction between the user and the model is handled by the Excel-based Graphical User Interface (GUI), which facilitates the use of UWOT by users unfamiliar with MATLAB and Simulink. Excel also contains the Technology Library spreadsheets, allowing the user to browse through the available water management technological options, obtain information on their performance and tailor their assessment to the particular problem at hand.

9-26.UWOT can be run in two modes: (a) assessment and (b) optimisation.
10.	In this mode, UWOT evaluates a user-defined configuration of an urban water management system (for a specific urban development). To initiate model simulation, the user needs to specify through the GUI the micro-components involved in the different types of houses and the different scales by configuring an on/off flag, which is associated with each technological option. Moreover, the user is asked to indicate whether water recycling schemes are to be included, specify the type of water to be treated and recycled (rainwater or greywater) and the spatial scale of the recycling’s implementation (household or development scale). Recycling schemes can be applied independently to each household type, by configuring each household’s recycling switches. This approach enables the comparison of different combinations of technologies and urban water management strategies.Finally, the user is asked to specify the priority by which each type of micro-component demands a particular water quality. Additional user inputs include information on the number of houses per household type and their corresponding occupancies, as well as data on their pervious, impervious and rain harvesting areas at the various scales. Finally, the user is asked to specify the desired duration of the simulation, after which UWOT populates the urban water cycle model with the specific micro- components suggested by the user, runs the full simulation processes the results within the MATLAB environment and exports them to Excel for visualisation. Two types of results are produced by the tool: (a) numerical values for all water streams, including potable water demand, wastewater and runoff generated, presented in total, daily and daily per capita values and plotted in bar diagrams to allow for a quick impression of the water balance of the simulated configuration. (b) a wider assessment created by obtaining values for the sustainability indicators in Table 1 for all the technologies present in the simulated configuration, for which the user has provided (context-specific) values for the particular situation by entering them into the technology library. In both cases, the indicator values of the proposed solution are standardised through fuzzy inference systems (FIS) against those of a user-defined benchmark scenario. The benchmark could be a system configuration that the user considers as business-as- usual. Such a configuration may include, for example, standard appliances, no recycling or harvesting and classic end-of-pipe drainage and wastewater collection technologies (which are also present in the technology library). This approach allows the inclusion in the same assessment process of both quantitative and qualitative criteria with different units and values and physical meanings. Consequently, the performance of different system configuration scenarios are assessed with respect to a (user-defined) point of reference, making the assessment context aware. This context-awareness is based on two elements: (a) the inclusion in the technology library of case-specific information (through, for example, consultation with local stakeholders) and (b) the fact that the assessment is acomparisonrather than ascorebetween a standard solution, given the circumstance, and a potential alternative one. This context dependency is an issue of paramount importance in the sustainability assessment debate.

11.	Genetic algorithms (GA) were used to provide optimisation capabilities to UWOT. GAs and evolutionary programming (EP) have recently seen a rise in their application in the water field, Keedwell and Khu, Makropoulos and Butler). This is primarily because GAs can be used to effectively solve large, complex, non-linear, discrete optimisation problems, such as found in urban water management. A discussion on GAs and their principles falls outside the scope of the present paper.The GA implementation in UWOT was developed using the MATLAB’s GA Toolbox and all parameters (initial population, mutation and crossover rates as well conversion criteria are set by the user through UWOT’s optimisation part of the GUI). For a detailed discussion of the algorithm and its setup the reader is referred to Natsis. The user specifies the boundary conditions of the problem, as in the assessment case, and is also presented with the option of pre-specifying a number of technological options that should be included in the final composite solution, without being subject to selection through optimisation. A solution includes: (a) a set of specific technological options for all micro-components (that are not pre-specified by the user) and (b) a set of configurations for the switches, specifying the inclusion (or not) within the solution of greywater recycling and/or rainwater harvesting. The algorithm is restricted to provide feasible solutions: some configurations are linked together (e.g. the choice of the installation of a greywater recycling scheme necessitates the existence of a greywater treatment micro- component), while others are not allowed (e.g. inappropriate treatment trains) through the use of a look-up table.

12.	The fitness of each solution is calculated on the basis of its sustainability against the indicators identified in Table 1. Since the GA used in this work is based on minimising a single objective, while the indicators (and consequently the objectives they represent) are multiple, the computed values for all indicators, standardised against the benchmark scenario using FIS (as in the assessment mode), are aggregated using two separate weighting schemes. A simple weighted averaging allows the incorporation of direct user preferences enabling the user to tailor the search to particular objectives. For example, allow the optimisation algorithm to minimise water demand and wastewater production only. Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) (Yager, 1988). This enables the aggregated fitness value to be influenced by the degree of optimism or pessimism of the decision- maker. A comprehensive discussion on this aggregation process in the context of UWOT is included in Natsis (2006). Both aggregation procedures can be employed at the same time if the nature of the problem requires it. The algorithm finishes when one of a set of end criteria are satisfied, which include incremental fitness improvement and maximum number of iterations. Once an optimal solution is reached, the corresponding set of technological options is identified and its sustainability ratings are communicated to the decision-maker through the graphical user interface, in their original disaggregated and non-weighted form. In both the case of assessment and optimisation, no further formal support is provided to rank the compared solutions, under the assumption that trade-offs between criteria need to be visible to the decision-maker rather than hidden behind aggregate values. It is assumed that the results of UWOT will be used as input to a further decision process, including possibly negotiation between stakeholders with diverging priorities and agendas, which will be aided by a clear display of the assessment of all solutions across a range of sustainability indicators.

13.	UWOT was applied to the problem of selecting water-related technologies for a new UK urban development, Elvetham Heath (EH), to test the water balance model, technology library and functionality of the decision support interface. UWOT was first applied to simulate the present situation in EH and afterwards to assess the sustainability of various alternative water management practices that could be applied in the new households during the development’s planned expansion. Elvetham Heath is a 126 ha development situated in Hampshire in the south east of England. It contains a natural reserve, car parks and 62 ha of a residential area, which houses, approximately, 4300 residents. The public space contains 42 ha of paved surfaces and 20 ha of unpaved surfaces. 1340 households had been constructed and occupied by April 2005 and 528 new households are planned to be completed by 2008, increasing, the total number of residents to 6000. The 1340 households consist of 29 1-bedroom apartments, 378 2-bedroom flats, 395 3-bedroom flats, 376 4-bedroom flats, 118 5-bedroom flats and 44 6-bedroom flats. Some alternative UWM practices have been successfully implemented in Elvetham Heath in the form of SUDS. The village runoff drainage system includes 21 swales/retention ponds that are successfully operating and also contribute to the aesthetic value of the village. A series of scenarios was developed to provide a basis for thinking about alternative development possibilities in the case study area. A discussion of scenarios of possible futures and their impact on urban water management is included in Makropoulos. In this paper we present only two of the scenarios developed as a proof of concept of the tool’s operation. A benchmark scenario is also presented, to allow for a common basis for comparisons. The benchmark scenario, or ‘business as usual’, resembles residential developments using conventional, water intensive technologies. The scenario uses population and household data specific to Elvetham Heath and makes use of conventional technologies at the household level assuming no rainwater harvesting, greywater recycling or SUDS. It also assumes that all water services, water supply, stormwater and wastewater conveyance and treatment, are delivered using centralised systems. Since rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling is not allowed in this scenario, the only source of water supply is potable water from the WSP. The mean per capita consumption corresponding to the EH development under the Benchmark scenario, calculated over a simulated period of 10 days, is approximately 168 l per capita per day (lcd). This is approximately 10% higher than the 150 lcd which is identified as a typical value for the UK. This can be attributed to the fact that the case study has a significant amount of gardens and associated outdoors water demand. Wastewater generation is approximately 85% of the water demand, which is in agreement with generally accepted losses of 5% within the house augmented by the 10% of demand due to gardening (water used in garden irrigation is not contributing to the measured wastewater flow). The results provide confidence that the model is well constructed and able to correctly simulate the water cycle within a development. The Water Save scenario is based on the same base data (number of houses, occupancy, pervious and impervious areas of the Elvetham Heath case study), but uses water saving technologies at the household level; for example, dual WC cisterns and low flow showerheads, which are selected (manually) by the user. This scenario is realistic as the technologies employed are already developed and both the market and society are progressively adopting them. Similar to the benchmark scenario, the Water Save scenario assumes no centralised greywater recycling and rainwater harvesting and the only source of water is the WSP external supply. The Water Save scenario shows a decrease in demand for potable water, indicating a per capita consumption of 109 lcd, which is in agreement with what literature suggests as possible following the installation of water saving devices. A series of quantitative outputs, used for the subsequent assessment of the scenarios discussed above, can be seen in 6. The Benchmark scenario values are used to define the setup of the FIS that is then used to evaluate the Water Save scenario and are always placed at equal distances from the centre of the spider diagram. A scenario value lower than the benchmark indicates poorer performance. Similarly, high scenario values are placed outside the benchmark values. In this example, we observe that, for example, indicators potable water demand and wastewater produced have improved at the expense of energy. Although the actual values of these indicators would depend on the specific technologies used, what can be generally suggested is that changes in the water cycle, through the introduction of water managing technologies have implications on the entire system and impact on a series of (sustainability) metrics. This complex, multicriteria (and ultimately multiobjective) nature of the problem is in fact the raison d’être of UWOT. In 7, we use the term objectives to refer both to the criteria of the assessment mode and the use of the same criteria as objectives for the optimisation mode. An Optimisation scenario, was developed to assess the potential of UWOT to identify solutions beyond what was immediately obvious to the end-user (represented here by the Water Save scenario). As discussed, the optimisation algorithm can handle multiobjective problems through weighting. To allow for a direct comparison between the Water Save and the Optimisation scenarios we have chosen to optimise exclusively for potable water demand, by setting its simple weighted averaging weight to 1 and allowing all other weights to assume the value of 0. An initial population of 100 individuals (each representing a potential solution to option selection process) was allowed to evolve for 30 generations. It can be seen that the algorithm, has identified a set of technological options that can achieve an even more pronounced reduction in water demand, lowering the per capita consumption to 93 lcd. An assessment of the optimisation scenario can be seen in 7. Similar to the Water Save scenario, some of the indicators (in this case, for example, potable water demand, wastewater produced and runoff) have improved, while others (such as energy or operation costs) have deteriorated. The effect is more pronounced as the optimisation scenario, to achieve a significant reduction in potable water demand has employed, in this case, greywater recycling at the local level. This can be observed through the indicators greenwater used and greywater used in 6. It is not suggested, that these results are necessarily optimal, as evolutionary algorithms can only guarantee near optimal solutions, and in any case the extent of the search was not sufficient to adequately cover such a complex solution space. It can be seen, however, that even with a few optimisation runs the tool can suggest solutions that outperform reasonablebest guessesby end- users. It is expected that as the technology library is updated with new entries of available technologies thus making the solution space more complicated, the gap between optimisation and best guess assessment would increase. The results of this example scenario may not even be desirable from a sustainability perspective, as the algorithm was asked to minimise potable water demand to the expense of all other criteria. It is suggested that a more balanced weight selection, would result in less pronounced water demand reductions, but would achieve this without significant decrease in the performance of other indicators. Such a multiobjective handling of the problem could also prove to be less intuitive to the user and it is in such situations that the tool’s capabilities would become more advantageous. In any case, a main advantage of the proposed tool and methodology is making trade-offs visible and allow decision-makers to understand the interaction between and implications of specific technology selection. Table 3, presents an example of the technologies selected for one of the 6 possible types of households represented in UWOT, under the 3 scenarios. Household type 1, in this case, represents single occupancy households, of which there are 11 at the EH case study. Each number is associated with a specific technology. For example, technology no 2 of the Toilet component is a toilet equipped with a dual valve 4/2 litre flush, whose average water demand is l/use. The presence of greywater recycling in the optimisation scenario can be seen from Table 3, in the selection of a treatment technology (in this case technology number no 1 as opposed to no treatment (indicated by zero) in the other two scenarios). This selection has implications in the selection of other technologies as the (significant) reductions in potable water achieved by greywater recycling allows the algorithm to select suboptimal technologies in other components of the cycle. In the example above, the optimisation algorithm suggests washing machine no3 although it is (slightly) inferior in terms of water consumption to washing machine no2. What is optimised here is the overall performance of the water cycle in the development and not necessarily of each household type individually. For the special case of one water source (potable water) and one criterion (for example, water demand reduction) then it can be argued that the optimal solution will always be the one that minimises all component solutions (in this case all household types). When multiple water sources are possible and the availability of some sources (such as grey or greenwater) is linked to water demand for certain water uses (for example, the use of washing machines) then the solutions become non-linear. For example, better reductions in energy may be achieved by allowing a washing machine type that requires more water provided that it then produces enough greenwater for other uses (for example, toilet flushing) that would otherwise request potable water, while not increasing overall potable water demand.UWOT is able to investigate such interactions and come up with insights on these and other trade-offs – notably between water, energy and land.

14.	This paper presents a decision support tool (UWOT) supporting the planning of water cycle management for new urban developments. The core of the tool consists of a component-based,flexible water mass balance model, an extensible technology library and a set of user-defined sustainability metrics. The underlying concepts, methodology and software development of the tool are discussed and its application to a case study in the UK presented. UWOT provides a holistic view of the urban water system within a new development, allowing water supply, wastewater collection and disposal as well as stormwater drainage to be considered as components of a single modelling framework. The tool was developed based on the following principles, which are embedded in its conceptual and methodological development. The sustainability discourse requires wide boundaries and consequently a wide range of metrics to allow for a mapping of those boundaries. Sustainability and its assessment must be relevant to the context at hand and cannot result in the same solution in every case. Sustainability is essentially an archetypal multiobjective problem. These principles were operationalised in UWOT in the following way. The use of user-specfied sustainability metrics: the user can update the values of the metrics in the technology library (using processes and tools appropriate to each individual indicator – not discussed here) to be consistent with the situation in a particular case study and/or include new metrics. Metrics can be either quantitative or qualitative indicators standardised through fuzzy inference systems. The technology library can be updated with new technologies without any need of updating the tool. Sustainability assessment is handled as a context- specfic issue, since the tool always assesses the sustainability of specific scenarios in comparison to user-specfied (case study dependent) benchmark scenarios. The decision- maker’s perception of risk can be taken into account in the process through OWA. Advanced optimisation in the form of GAs is used to explore the complex solution space and suggest alternatives based on the full range of sustainability metrics and decision-maker preferences.

15.	UWOT was tested using data from the Elvetham Heath residential development. The results of the tool’s application reveal that the modelling approach adopted is valid and that the fundamental algorithms for water allocation and the underlying flow logic between model components are reasonable. Results indicate that the tool is useful in identifying and presenting to the user, trade-offs across a series of sustainability indicators resulting from the interaction between urban water flows. Specifically, the tool allows the investigation of trade-offs between quantitative indicators and qualitative indicators in a visually comprehensible manner that facilitates group decision-making and negotiation, without oversimplifying matters by presenting only aggregated values. Following the application presented in this paper as well as in Natsis and Makropoulos it is suggested that UWOT can: assist the investigation and quantification of interactions and transformations of the three urban water flows within the same modelling framework, facilitate the selection of combinations of water managing technologies and ultimately support the delivery of integrated, sustainable water management for new developments. As technology changes in response to social, economic and environmental drivers and urban water management solutions become more customised to address context-specific issues within both centralised and distributed water management systems, the solution space for informed option selection to manage the water cycle will become more complex. The emergence of multiple actors with potentially coflicting views and priorities suggest the need for thinking (software and modelling) platforms that can facilitate discussion and negotiations by the provision of information and the quick assessment of alternative what-if scenarios. UWOT, developed within the WaND initiative, is such a prototype tool able to assist the integrated provision of water management solutions taking into account both the interactions between water flows and the trade-off between multiple qualitative and quantitative sustainability criteria.
