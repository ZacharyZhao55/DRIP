1. Within coupled hydrological simulation systems, taking socio-economic processes into account is still a challenging task. In particular, systems that aim at evaluating impacts of climatic change on large spatial and temporal scales cannot be based on the assumption that infrastructure, economy, demography and other human factors remain constant while physical boundary conditions change. Therefore, any meaningful simulation of possible future scenarios needs to enable socio-economic systems to react and to adapt to climatic changes. To achieve this it is necessary to simulate decision making processes of the relevant actors in a way which is adequate for the scale, the catchment specific management problems to be investigated and finally the data availability. This contribution presents the DEEPACTOR approach for representing such human decision processes, which makes use of a multi-actor simulation framework and has similarities to agent-based approaches. This DEEPACTOR approach is embedded in DANUBIA, a coupled simulation system comprising 16 individual models to simulate Global Change impacts on the entire water cycle of the Upper Danube. The applicability of DANUBIA and in particular the DEEPACTOR approach for treating the socio-economic part of the water cycle in a process-based way is demonstrated by means of concrete simulation models of the water supply sector and of the domestic water users. Results from scenario simulations are used to demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of the approach.

3. Suppose a decision maker or, more generally, a stakeholder wants to know if the available water resources in a large, diverse catchment will still meet the water demands of various water users in 30 years' time, assuming that the worst predictions of Global Climate Models (GCM) downscaled to regional conditions come true. More specifically, this decision maker wants to know where and when in the catchment problems are to be expected in order to plan counter measures and to allocate appropriate financial resources. In order to answer these questions, the decision maker needs tools to predict the development of (a) the state of the catchment's natural water resources, (b) the water demands of the different consumers under a changed climate and (c) the state of the water supply infrastructure and its ability to provide for adequate water supply. All these predictions need to be spatially and temporally explicit, if the 'where' and the 'when' questions are to be addressed. Physical models are traditionally used to predict the spatially and temporally explicit state of water resources. The traditional prediction of demands relies on data driven methods such as trend extrapolation, regression analysis, time series analysis, rule and expert knowledge based systems, etc. However, all methods that neglect the existing feedbacks between demand and supply and the various options of adaptation the consumers have, are unrealistic or even meaningless. As indicated in Fig 1, Climate Change will affect not only the state of resources but also the ways and the magnitude of consumption ( introduction of irrigation if the climate gets dryer). Changing consumption will in turn lead to an additional change of the resources state; the resources state might influence the attitude towards consumption or invoke legally defined restrictions for consumption. Consumers might then adapt their consumption to decreasing resources (save water) and/or water suppliers might increase resources by, for example, importing water from neighbouring catchments. Furthermore, the number of consumers might decrease  because water intensive industries close down. Finally, it must be taken into account that different consumers will react differently to changes according to their possibilities, their preferences and their location. Therefore, an attempt to simulate such complex systems with their numerous mutual interdependences needs to.

We suggest that both sides should be simulated by the most appropriate state of the art models and are doubtful whether combined approaches where natural science modelling concepts are imposed to social systems or concepts known from social sciences are used to form simplified conceptual representations of natural systems are appropriate.

7.Without attempting to cover all dependencies shown in Fig1, this article presents an approach to include feedback and adaptation by simulating responses of the socio-economic framework to Global Change by using 'actors' to simulate human decision makers at various levels from individual households to communities and large companies. Note, that although our approach follows ideas from the field of agentbased social simulation we use the term 'actor' instead of 'agent' to avoid name clashes with the term 'software agents', which have a more specific meaning in the computer sciences. Hereby we focus upon the domestic water consumption and the drinking water supply infrastructure. The developed approach will hence be referred to as the DEEPACTOR approach that is embedded in the DANUBIA simulation system. To summarise, the approach presented here is.

17.The changes of objectives and options listed above, which for a large part are combined in the European Water Framework Directive, clearly demand new approaches for dealing with the management of water resources. Management must consider a multitude of aspects and objectives, larger spatial areas and, finally, the variability of natural and social boundary conditions.It is clear that such a multifaceted management requires the integration of expert knowledge from many disciplines: the effects of Global Climate Change on water and land resources cannot be evaluated on the basis of one discipline alone. Therefore management approaches are required that integrate the relevant disciplines and make use of existing knowledge and models and that deal with management problems on the appropriate scale. A very comprehensive discussion of most of the aspects discussed in the above listed enumeration can be found in.Integrated assessment and management, multi-objective decision making and the involvement of human actors and stakeholders are topics which are extensively discussed in works of Tony Jakeman, Claudia Pahl-Wostl and their coauthors.

18.Dealing with uncertainty of assumptions, models and data are a major concern of IWRM under conditions of Global (Climate) Change and a crucial aspect for the reliability and acceptance of model results.An accepted way of reducing uncertainty or showing the influence of uncertain processes on model results is by modelling the actual processes. Today, it is a common understanding that the less conceptual a model is and the more realistic individual processes are represented, the better a model can be used in decision making and for stakeholder discussions.In water resources management, natural processes ( groundwater flow) have long been treated as physical based as possible. Social processes on the other hand ( changes of water demand per capita) have mainly been dealt with on a highly conceptual basis. Under conditions of Global Change, the use of conceptual approaches to model social processes is questionable, as they largely ignore that human decisions and behaviour are changed as a result of (Global) change. Human decisions made in reaction to changing natural conditions (eg water consumption or the expansion of a water supply network) change the actors' environment and form a new basis for future decisions. Furthermore, human behaviour not only adapts to change but also undergoes an evolution that might be forced by external drivers or be random. Therefore it seems judicious to extend the idea of process-based modelling to the socioeconomic components of an integrated simulation system in an effort to reduce their uncertainty and to improve their transparency. Mechanisms need to be provided for social systems to respond to changes and for capturing the effects of these responses upon the environment. Process-based in that context means capturing the triggers, options, and temporal and spatial aspects of an actor's reaction in a direct, transparent and realistic way.

19.Comparison with other approaches Predicting future water availability and water demand has always been one of the central questions in water resources management. Accordingly, many approaches for simulating and predicting the state of resources and the evolution of demands, amongst them also many agent-based simulation approaches, exist. The specific problem at hand requires (a) an integration of natural and socioeconomic processes, (b) the consideration of multiple actors with different options and preferences, (c) a regional scale focus, (d) distributed, spatially and temporarily explicit models.It is therefore not meaningful to compare the developed DEEPACTOR approach to approaches that deal with demand or supply predictions on a sectoral basis and approaches that are dedicated to describe small-scale systems in a discrete4 way or lumped regional models. As already pointed out there is a growing demand for integrated management and assessment of resources on a regional scale which has accordingly brought upon a number of regional integrated research projects and approaches. None of these projects has to our knowledge come up with a fully coupled system or model that represents responses of the socio-economic framework in a process-oriented way. Simulation models that address the environmental impacts and socio-economic effects together in a fully integrated way were for example presented by Wu, Kirshen, Watkins and Yamout and El-Fadel, however with a focus on smaller systems on the local scale. Athanasiadis and López-Paredes provide regional and integrated models for water management, including both water suppliers or municipalities and area residents. Although implemented as agent-based models, both approaches do not explicitly represent the processes involved in the case of water scarcity on the supply and on the demand side. Moss sketch a promising approach within the FIRMA project that explicitly includes policy makers and consumers. However, this approach seems to be not sufficiently specific with respect to the explicit representation of important variables such as water demand. The negotiation process simulated in the approach of Thoyer and the model of Espinasse and Franchesquin focus on a small local scale. Berger and Feuillette describe integrated approaches to model water management which are not applicable to central European water management due to water resources being a major influence on farming and therefore on household income in both cases.In view of this brief discussion which of course cannot reflect all agent-based or integrated simulation approaches in the water sector, we are not aware of any approach that would fulfil the requirements explained in Section 2 in a problem context as exemplified in Section 1.

20.GLOWA-Danube GLOWA-Danube is one of five projects within the GLOWA-programme. Within GLOWA, integrated approaches for carrying out Global Change research are compared using six catchments in different climates on different continents. The central aim of GLOWA is to provide an integrated approach for describing, modelling, and forecasting physical, social, economic, and political processes related to the hydrological cycle, in particular with regard to Global Change on the river basin scale, in order to meet the requirements of modern IWRM.In GLOWA-Danube, the Upper Danube watershed was selected as a representative regional-scale test catchment in the temperate mid-latitudes, covering an area of approx 77,000 km2. GLOWA-Danube equally considers the influence of natural changes in the ecosystem, such as Climate Change, and social changes,  changes in land use or water consumption. The central objective of GLOWA-Danube is the joint development and application of the Decision Support System (DSS) DANUBIA. The GLOWA-Danube consortium comprises a universitybased network of roughly 40 scientists from the fields of meteorology, hydrology, hydrogeology, hydraulic engineering, plant ecology, environmental psychology, environmental economics, agricultural economics, glaciology, remote sensing, tourism research and computer sciences. The project started in January 2001 and will terminate in April 2010. The first phase of the project was dedicated to the development of the DANUBIA prototype.In the second project phase, the consolidation and application of DANUBIA, scenario evaluation, stakeholder involvement, decision making, and practical water and land use management support were in the centre of the research activities.In addition the process-based simulations in the socio-economic sector were further developed. The third phase has the main objectives of: (a) making DANUBIA practically available for the management of water and land resources in the Upper Danube catchment, and (b) making DANUBIA and all its components available and usable for scientists and end users under an open source licence.

21.The Upper Danube catchment is a heterogeneous, mountainous catchment with altitudes ranging from 287 to 4049 m asl, precipitation between 650 and >2000 mm/a, evaporation between 450 and 550 mm/a, discharge between 150 and mm/a, average annual temperature between and þ9 C and approximately million inhabitants. The last century showed a rapid transgression from a mainly agricultural society to a highly industrialised high-tech economy (mainly IT, automotive, chemistry). However, industrial activities are quite focussed in few urban agglomerations leaving vast parts of the country to traditional farming and tourist activities. The latter in particular are a major source of income and therefore a major concern of GLOWA-Danube. The parallel evolution of a high tech industry on the one hand and the need for preserving the nature for agriculture and recreation purposes on the other hand forms a major source of conflicting interests. DANUBIA was developed as an instrument to help decision makers and stakeholders to solve such conflicts. Water resources management in the Upper Danube is complex, partly because the watershed area extends over a number of countries, but even more due to the very distributed nature of the water supply system. Well over a 2400 municipalities are supplied by roughly 2000 independent water supply companies, leading to a highly distributed scheme of supplier consumer relations. Water supply in the public sector is mainly (90%) groundwater based.

22.DANUBIA currently comprises a total of 16 disciplinary simulation models, which are coupled to each other in order to exchange data dynamically during runtime. As depicted in the UML  diagram of Fig. 3, main components to group domain-related simulation models are used. Natural science simulation models address physical processes concerned with the natural water cycle and water availability whereas so-called actor models address demography, water consumption and supply infrastructure in the investigation area simulate the socio-economic aspects of the water cycle using an 'agent-based' social simulation framework. The system is used to evaluate the sustainability of future water resources management alternatives, and to evaluate consequences of IPCC derived climate scenarios for the period from 2000 to 2100. Table 1 summarises purpose and scale of the socio-economic simulation models of DANUBIA which can make use of the DEEPACTOR approach. To facilitate the smooth integration of the different simulation models, DANUBIA makes use of an object-oriented framework approach. Following this approach, the development of the individual simulation models is based on common modelling and implementation frameworks.In the following we briefly describe DANUBIA's developer framework which provides the basic simulationrelated model features required for all model implementations of DANUBIA.In DANUBIA, the simulation area is modelled by a fixed 2-dimensional grid comprising cells of 1 1 km. Each cell can be identified by a unique ID and is modelled by an object that has a state determined by attributes, for example elevation. Apart from such general cell attributes common to all simulation models, there are also model-specific cell attributes, for example soil temperature in case of the simulation model Soil. Following an object-oriented approach, the cells may also perform calculations in the form of functions computed over local values of the particular cell. For this reason we call the cells proxels, an acronym of 'process pixel'. The values of the model-specific proxel attributes are subject to the data exchange between different coupled simulation models, which is formally specified by interfaces. A DANUBIA interface gathers the methods used for data exchange, one for each parameter, and is accompanied by a specification of allowed data ranges. For each simulation model, there is an interface specifying its required import data and an export interface specifying the data which is provided, computed by this model. The main purpose of these specifications is to ensure the consistent interconnection of the different simulation models of the project partners within DANUBIA during runtime. DANUBIA provides concepts and an implementation for the treatment of simulation time. On the one hand, any simulation model participating in a coupled simulation follows the same abstract simulation cycle of getting data, internal computation, provision of data, getting data and so forth. On the other hand, each model defines an individual local time step, such as 1 h, 1 day, 1 month and so forth, depending on the particular process to be modelled. Therefore, while a 1 h model runs 24 cycles, a concurrently executed 1 day model runs one cycle only. In order to coordinate the simulation models in the coupled system such that mutual exclusion of data exchange with respect to individual time steps is taken into account, a coordination mechanism was developed, whose concepts, design, implementation and formal verification is detailed in Barth , Hennicker and Ludwig and Hennicker and Ludwig and will not be further discussed here.
22-1.DANUBIA currently comprises a total of 16 disciplinary simulation models, which are coupled to each other in order to exchange data dynamically during runtime. 
22-2.As depicted in the UML  diagram, main components to group domain-related simulation models are used. #relationship:0# 22-3.Natural science simulation models address physical processes concerned with the natural water cycle and water availability whereas so-called actor models address demography, water consumption and supply infrastructure in the investigation area simulate the socio-economic aspects of the water cycle using an 'agent-based' social simulation framework. #relationship:0# 22-4.The system is used to evaluate the sustainability of future water resources management alternatives, and to evaluate consequences of IPCC derived climate scenarios for the period from 2000 to 2100. 
22-5.Table 1 summarises purpose and scale of the socio-economic simulation models of DANUBIA which can make use of the DEEPACTOR approach. 
22-6.To facilitate the smooth integration of the different simulation models, DANUBIA makes use of an object-oriented framework approach. #relationship:0# 22-7.Following this approach, the development of the individual simulation models is based on common modelling and implementation frameworks.
22-8.In the following we briefly describe DANUBIA's developer framework which provides the basic simulationrelated model features required for all model implementations of DANUBIA.In DANUBIA, the simulation area is modelled by a fixed 2-dimensional grid comprising cells of 11 km. 
22-9.Each cell can be identified by a unique ID and is modelled by an object that has a state determined by attributes, for example elevation. #relationship:C# 22-10.Apart from such general cell attributes common to all simulation models, there are also model-specific cell attributes, for example soil temperature in case of the simulation model Soil. #relationship:D# 22-11.Following an object-oriented approach, the cells may also perform calculations in the form of functions computed over local values of the particular cell. #relationship:A# 22-12.For this reason we call the cells proxels, an acronym of 'process pixel'. 
22-13.The values of the model-specific proxel attributes are subject to the data exchange between different coupled simulation models, which is formally specified by interfaces. 
22-14.A DANUBIA interface gathers the methods used for data exchange, one for each parameter, and is accompanied by a specification of allowed data ranges. 
22-15.For each simulation model, there is an interface specifying its required import data and an export interface specifying the data which is provided, computed by this model. #relationship:D# 22-16.The main purpose of these specifications is to ensure the consistent interconnection of the different simulation models of the project partners within DANUBIA during runtime. 
22-17.DANUBIA provides concepts and an implementation for the treatment of simulation time.  #relationship:D# 22-18.On the one hand, any simulation model participating in a coupled simulation follows the same abstract simulation cycle of getting data, internal computation, provision of data, getting data and so forth. #relationship:D# 22-19.On the other hand, each model defines an individual local time step, such as 1 h, 1 day, 1 month and so forth, depending on the particular process to be modelled. #relationship:D# 22-20.Therefore, while a 1 h model runs 24 cycles, a concurrently executed 1 day model runs one cycle only. 
22-21.In order to coordinate the simulation models in the coupled system such that mutual exclusion of data exchange with respect to individual time steps is taken into account, a coordination mechanism was developed, whose concepts, design, implementation and formal verification is detailed in Barth, Hennicker and Ludwig and Hennicker and Ludwig and will not be further discussed here.

23.In contrast to physical processes, social processes are often the result of complex considerations, which include individual possibilities and preferences along with characteristic behaviour. In order to better support the modelling and simulation of this kind of entity in DANUBIA, the DEEPACTOR framework was developed, providing a common conceptual and architectural basis for the modelling and implementation of the socio-economic simulation models in GLOWA-Danube. Following their concrete requirements, the framework applies an approach to agent-based simulation in social sciences, which in turn is based upon agent concepts of (distributed) artificial intelligence. Deciding entities such as individuals, organisations, companies and so forth are explicitly modelled and simulated as 'actors'. An actor observes its environment and selects plans to execute as a reaction to its observations. Thereby different actors may have different courses-ofaction as well as varying preferences, represented by their individual plans and their type-specific decision procedure. Besides providing the modelling support for simple reactive actors up to more complex deciding entities, which would in principle also be supported by toolkits and libraries for agent-based social simulation such as Repast, MASON or Swarm, the DEEPACTOR framework also provides an integration with the developer framework and the runtime environment of DANUBIA. Therefore concrete DEEPACTOR models may be integrated and coupled with any other simulation model of GLOWA-Danube using the same basic concepts and mechanisms for coordinated exchange of spatially explicit data (via formally specified interfaces) as for any other simulation model of DANUBIA. Both the DANUBIA and the DEEPACTOR frameworks apply object-oriented techniques to provide the basic building blocks for model implementations in the form of interfaces, abstract base classes and predefined relationships. A concrete DEEPACTOR model may implement different specialisations using different concrete subclasses of the abstract base classes, each of them implementing inherited abstract methods in a different, typespecific way. In the following, the most important static elements of the framework are explained. After that, possibilities for the implementation of model computations on the one hand and actor decisions on the other hand are described. It must be stressed that some of the provided framework features are optional. Therefore its concrete application, or maybe better, its reification, may well differ between different simulation models.

24.Fig4 shows a conceptual view of the interfaces, base classes and relationships that are relevant for the development of a DEEPACTOR model. The upper part shows the most important elements of the DANUBIA developer framework which are inherited by the DEEPACTOR framework shown in the lower part of the figure. Any DEEPACTOR model implementation (specialisation of AbstractActorModel) is a DANUBIA model (AbstractDanubiaModel) following the same core concepts as natural-science model implementations, it comprises a set of proxels representing the simulation area (AbstractProxel), specifies import and export interfaces for the data exchange with coupled simulation models (DanubiaInterface), defines a local timestep and finally proceeds in a cyclic fashion with the implementations of data import (getData), local computation (compute) and data export (provide). The cyclic execution is coordinated by the runtime environment of DANUBIA according to the particular model timestep. DEEPACTOR models extend the concepts of a DANUBIA model, amongst others, by a number of new methods that are executed cyclically.In order to integrate these extensions transparently for the runtime environment, the DEEPACTOR framework maps invocations of methods of the base class AbstractDanubiaModel to calls of methods of base classes AbstractActorModel, AbstractActor, AbstractPlan and AbstractAction as well as methods of concrete DEEPACTOR framework classes such as the implementation of sensors or the history. For example the sensors are triggered to update their data directly after getData of the model implementation is executed, compute is implemented by an invocation of preCompute followed by calls to options and filter for all actors, and finally completed by an invocation of the model's postCompute. Last but not least the actors' histories are triggered to update their state just before the model implementation of provide is executed. An actor represents an entity capable of reacting to system changes in an individual way, it is capable of making decisions. The individuality is thereby achieved by individual properties and preferences of each actor object. Fig 5 demonstrates schematically how the individual properties and preferences are assigned. It has to be noted that, since the simulation area in DANUBIA is represented by a set of 1 1 km proxel objects, an actor in the most cases does not explicitly represent a real person or organisation but rather an abstract, effective 'average' of real actors located on one or more proxels which in turn define the environment of this actor. To show an example of averaging actors, if 100 real households exist in a proxel (model cell) for which 30% of the households belong to the 'conservative' household actor type and 70% belong to the 'progressive' household actor type, then the corresponding proxel will host two actors. The domestic water demand on such a grid cell is then computed as a weighted average of the water demand of these two actor types.

24-9.Fig 5 demonstrates schematically how the individual properties and preferences are assigned. #relationship:0# 24-10.It has to be noted that, since the simulation area in DANUBIA is represented by a set of 1 1 km proxel objects, an actor in the most cases does not explicitly represent a real person or organisation but rather an abstract, effective 'average' of real actors located on one or more proxels which in turn define the environment of this actor. #relationship:C# 24-11.To show an example of averaging actors, if 100 real households exist in a proxel (model cell) for which 30% of the households belong to the 'conservative' household actor type and 70% belong to the 'progressive' household actor type, then the corresponding proxel will host two actors. #relationship:D# 24-12.The domestic water demand on such a grid cell is then computed as a weighted average of the water demand of these two actor types.

25.As depicted in Fig4, one of the basic actor properties is its location, usually defined by a set of proxel object IDs. Also an actor may define a number of collaborators, other actor objects of the same DEEPACTOR model that this actor needs to collaborate with. The concept of collaborators allows establishing or simulating social network aspects. These basic properties may be assigned in concrete actor types and additional properties such as an attribute to store the number of wells may be declared.

26.The plans (AbstractPlan) of an actor represent its course-of-actions and its options.A plan in turn refers to a set of actions (AbstractAction), each of them explicitly modelling some state modification associated with the execution of the particular plan.Individual type-specific preferences may then be encoded by the type-specific implementation of a plan selection algorithm within filter and options. Based on the DEEPACTOR framework, a whole variety of decision algorithms can be implemented, ranging from simple habits or heuristics to elaborate cognitive decisions. To simplify both priority-based decision procedures and decision algorithms based on the Multiattribute Utility Theory, a plan may store a rating attribute. In the former case, this value may be fixed initially and kept constant during runtime. In the latter case a function (computeRating) may be implemented which dynamically computes a new rating value in each time step. Plans are activated and deactivated during the decision procedure of an actor. The actions associated with activated plans (isActive) are executed (execute). An activated plan may fail to be executed if its actions were not executable, due to time period constraints (period, isApplicable) or the like. A number of sensors (Sensor) allows an actor to observe its environment by directly reading raw data or by being notified about the occurrence of pre-defined events. An event is a fixed modelspecific interpretation of raw data.In fact, sensors merely encapsulate the data import facilities of an actor, adding the possibility of qualitative interpretation using modelspecific events. Currently the framework provides three types of sensors. The proxel sensor enables importing proxel values computed within other simulation models. The constraint sensor allows retrieving constraints, legal requirements needing to be observed and which may have an impact on the decisions to be made. The actor sensor enables importing data from other actor objects of the same model. The value of the attribute collaborators specifies exactly which actors these are. Finally, each actor disposes of a history (History), tracing successful and failed plan execution of previous time steps by storing the corresponding plan IDs (execPlans, failedPlans), therefore providing the possibility to implement actors with some form of learning capabilities. The history base class may also be subject to different extensions for different concrete actor type implementations. An actor decides within each time step of the particular simulation model. The decision incorporates four fundamental methods:  The actors observe its environment via the three sensor types described above. According to the actors' characteristics and preferences available plans are loaded and made available for the succeeding decision in the filter step. This includes the recalculation of the rating of all loaded plans (computeRating). Implements the definite plan selection. After this step the set of actions of each selected plan is executed which usually results in the (re-)computation of some proxel or actor attributes. Afterwards, the final plan execution status is stored in the history. The results of actors relevant for their collaborators are stored to be available via the actor sensor in the next time step.

27.The decision process of actors is embedded within computations of a model's 'main' class (specialisation of AbstractActorModel). After having imported data from other models (getData), the instance of this class may optionally prepare (preCompute) and postprocess (postCompute) its actors' decisions, allowing for example the aggregation of some fine-grained results before providing them to other DANUBIA simulation models (provide). Note that the possibility to pre- and post-process within the same simulated time step allows implementing a macro level of simulation which dynamically takes into account the results of the 'agent-based' part of the simulation model, as described in , amongst others. The pre- and post processing steps of the two chosen model implementations discussed in the next sections will not be addressed in full detail here as they are based on rather simple, yet many calculations and were in principle described in previous publications.

28.The models Household and WaterSupply were chosen as examples from the 6 available model implementations, since the water supply system and the domestic users form the 'core' of water management in many regions. WaterSupply is a model of the water supply sector comprising water extraction, treatment and distribution. Household is a model for estimating the water usage of households under changing environmental conditions. Before describing the models, we will briefly introduce the general idea of how the two models interact. This can best be demonstrated for a situation of water scarcity. Within GLOWADanube 'water shortage' is not understood as a technical issue only, but also and foremost as a term related to sustainability of water resources and the good ecological status of natural systems.It is obvious that responses to water shortage are actor- and actor type-specific. Large water supply companies can increase their capacity by tapping new sources and by importing water from other areas while small companies usually only have the first option if they don't collaborate with other companies. The response options of water supply companies are generally rather constrained by legal restrictions and economic considerations. Consumers in the domestic sector on the other hand may reduce their water demand by reducing the irrigation of gardens or changing bathing and showering habits. Here, legal and economic constraints are much less important for the behaviour of individual households than for public water suppliers. Whereas certain households might adjust their habits only to an actual physical water shortage (no more water from the tap) others will obey much earlier to appeals to save water.It is within this framework of different options and preferences where the interesting interaction between water suppliers and water consumers takes place. Both sides will react to system changes (here decreasing resources) in typical ways. However, only the water supply companies have the data and knowledge to assess the current and future situation whereas consumers rely on secondary information. Therefore the response of the two actors (suppliers and consumers) will take place in a stepwise and distributed way: First, water supply companies will try to make a prediction on the future development of the available resources. Minor problems will usually be overcome by a temporal increase of capacities (using strategic reserves etc) without letting the public know. If it is foreseeable that resources and reserves together will not be enough to meet the demand and no significant replenishment of the resources can be expected before the crisis approaches, the public will be informed and encouraged to save water. This usually happens in different stages: early warnings (information on potential upcoming shortages), direct appeals to save water, restriction of certain water uses and finally periodical system shut downs. What exactly the coping and information strategy of a specific water supply company looks like and how a specific consumers reacts (if he follows the appeal and obeys the restrictions) depends on the individual options and preferences. As described above, the interface between the two actors (supplier and consumer) is asymmetric. The suppliers have the full knowledge of the system whereas the individual consumers simply consume without being fully aware of how they influence the system.In DANUBIA, the Household model (consumers) sends the demands per model cell and time step to the WaterSupply model whereas the WaterSupply models provides 'information' on the state of the water supply system. This information is provided in a condensed form using so-called 'flags'. Flags assume integer values from 1 (good) to 5 (catastrophic). The WaterSupply model calculates the flags at each time step based upon a set of physical parameters (see below). With respect to the models described hereafter (WaterSupply and Household), two different types of flags are of importance: The groundwater quantity (GQN) and quality (GQL) flags describe the system state of the groundwater resources in a defined zone. The flags are computed for a complete groundwater body, an array of proxels with similar hydrogeological properties. The drinking water quantity (DQN) flag describes the state of the water supply system. A DQN flag is valid for the supply area of a water supply company.

29.The calculation of the GQN flag is a moderately complex procedure that relies on the results of the DANUBIA models Soil, Rivernetwork and Groundwater.In principle the GQN flag calculation is based on an analysis of the changes in groundwater recharge, groundwater level and river discharge (baseflow) with respect to reference conditions. The description of the approach would require a sound explanation of the aforementioned hydrological models and an introduction into the hydrological and hydrogeological characteristics of the catchment. Such a description is given in. DQN flags indicate the quantitative state of the drinking water resources at the disposal of the water suppliers.It is a water supplier evaluation of the quantitative changes in availability of drinking water resources that is further committed to the water users in terms of states from 1 to 4. Essentially, DQN flags represent the simple and standardised way to transfer information about the states of the resources and available supplies that in the real world occur through public media, governmental announcements or the like. Real world analogies for the DQN flag concept can mainly be found in Australia. Fig6 shows the principles of data exchange between the models that provide the data for the flag calculation and the flag exchange between the models WaterSupply and Household.

29-7.Essentially, DQN flags represent the simple and standardised way to transfer information about the states of the resources and available supplies that in the real world occur through public media, governmental announcements or the like. #relationship:C# 29-8.Real world analogies for the DQN flag concept can mainly be found in Australia. 
29-9.Fig6 shows the principles of data exchange between the models that provide the data for the flag calculation and the flag exchange between the models WaterSupply and Household.

30.The WaterSupply model simulates the provision of water from sources to consumers. Having a focus on the public drinking water supply of the Upper Danube Catchment, the sectoral goal of WaterSupply is to identify regions that could experience water stress in the future, resulting either from climate-induced or water-quality-related changes on the supply side or demand-side changes, quantitative, qualitative, spatial and temporal changes in water consumption. WaterSupply aims to demonstrate the ability of present water supply schemes to compensate such changes and to evaluate the effects of different interventions to solve or prevent problems arising as a result of change.In this context it is important to point out that not the technical infrastructure of individual supply companies is modelled, but rather the supply areas, the important groundwater and surface water bodies used, the degree of use, cooperation between companies, and long-distance water transportation schemes. The model is therefore neither a prediction tool of future water supply infrastructure nor a design tool on the company level.It can only serve for the evaluation of the water supply strategies on a catchment level. Within these described limitations, WaterSupply does foresee typical response mechanisms on a company basis to compensate for change,  the change of preferences regarding resources used or a stronger reliance upon long-distance water supply.In order to achieve its goals, WaterSupply reads the quantitative state of water resources at pre-defined spatial and temporal units, interprets water availability according to sustainability requirements of predefined natural parameters such as groundwater recharge or river water discharge and evaluates the ability of the present water supply schemes to comply with the dynamics of user demand. WaterSupply seeks then both to simulate typical behaviour of supply companies within the limitations specified above and to identify critical regions for which further, more extensive or fundamental adaptation of the water supply scheme will become necessary under changing boundary conditions.

31.WaterSupply model WaterSupply is a strictly object-oriented simulation model that implements the decision making of water supply companies based on the DEEPACTOR framework. Fig7 provides a structural overview of the model implementation. At the core of the model is the distinction between water supply companies (WaterSupplyCompany, WSC) and communities (Community, COM). Furthermore, we distinguish between local WSC, which act on the community level(CommunityWSC), and regional WSC, representing all forms of grouped and joined suppliers that transfer water among communities (RegionalWSC). These actor types are equipped with different preferences and different course-of-actions in the form of plans and actions. Communities represent the consumers and are modelled explicitly because they are the legally responsible entities for water supply in Germany. By the summation of imported water demands from other socio-economic models, a COM knows where and how much water is consumed. Furthermore, a COM knows from which WSC it is primarily served; typically these are local suppliers.In contrast, a WSC possesses information regarding extraction sites, water rights, raw water quality and collaborating WSC. Extraction sites are mainly groundwater wells where water rights (capacity constraints) are defined by site-specific extraction limits set by the water authorities. The basis of WaterSupply is the comparison of demands obtained by COM with the existing and potential supply capacity evaluated for the current state of the resources. The result of the above mentioned comparison triggers a 'decision' on behalf of the particular WSC actor. To 'decide' means here to select and execute an appropriate plan, consisting of a predefined set of actions with the aim of satisfying water demands either by exploiting existing capacities or by opening new ones. The selection of a plan is not only dependent on demand and state of the resources but also on the type of the WSC (local or regional), its location and its collaborators.

32.WaterSupply model During model initialisation, static model and actor attributes are set and dynamic attributes are initialised. Static attributes that are not modified during the simulation are for example existing water sources, company supply areas or transport links among companies. Source's capacities, withdrawal values or the state of the resources need to be modified during run time and are therefore examples for dynamically assigned attributes. After initialisation, the model follows the common DANUBIA computation cycle of data import, computation and data export with a time step of one month. In getData, the demands calculated and exported by the Actor models Household, Farming, Economy and Tourism. Output data such as groundwater level, river discharge or groundwater recharge is imported from the natural science models Groundwater, Rivernetwork and Soil. The data imported from the natural science models is used to assess the state of the supply side, the quantitative and qualitative status of the groundwater and surface water resources (GQN flag). The output of the Actor models is used to calculate the total drinking water demands that accrue at each time step (preCompute). Based on the comparison among the available supplies and demands needed at each time step (preCompute), the decision-making ability of the water suppliers is activated in order to respond to potential future problems and to make structural changes accordingly.In technical terms this translates to the execution of the DeepWSC implementation of the actor methods specified by the DEEPACTOR framework. The single steps are implemented as described in the following: The necessity for change arises either from growing demands, which surpass the present capacity, or from a quantitative degradation of one or more of the present sources in use, which leads to a capacity reduction. These are perceived by the WaterSupply actors via their sensors. The actors use the proxel sensor to import natural science data and the actor sensor to import data from collaborating WSC. According to the WSC type (CommunityWSC or RegionalWSC) and the characteristics, preferences and the available plans are loaded. The decision procedure to select, activate and execute one of the available plans is depicted in the UML activity diagram in Fig9. The parameters necessary for plan selection are supplier type, demand, usable capacity, collaborators, number of potential sources, GQN flags of sources and potential sources. A detailed description of this procedure can be found in. After selection of a plan, its set of actions is executed which results in the modification of the water supply characteristics such as an expansion of existing sources, tapping of new sources, or relieving or closing overused sources, thus increasing the demands sent to a collaborating regional or long-distance supplier. The results of WaterSupply actors relevant for the collaborators of the WSC are stored to be available via the actor sensor in the next time step. Finally, the changes of the water supply structure and its view of the state of the resources are actualised (postCompute) and made visible to the other DANUBIA simulation models (provide). The main results are the actual withdrawal quantities exported to the Rivernetwork and Groundwater models as well as DQN flags exported to other Actor models.

33.The main purpose of the Household model is to simulate the water use of domestic households under changing climatic conditions, showing plausible reactions of households to water scarcity or rising temperatures. Simulation results include water demand, wastewater and the water-related satisfaction of households. In order to calculate the water demand, ten water-usages such as showering, toilet flushing or laundry washing are distinguished. Within the Household model, Household actors decide upon these ten specific water uses. The model sums up the respective water demands and the overall demand is sent to the WaterSupply model. The most important import parameters for the Household actors' decision procedure are the drinking water price and the DQN flags, both provided by the model WaterSupply, and the air temperature, computed within the component Atmosphere.

34.The 'deciding entity' of the model is the household, not an individual person, because water-related behaviours such as the installation of water-use technologies or the frequency of laundry and dish washing are related to entire households. Households are categorised according to the sociological concept of lifestyles. For the model implementation, the Sinus Sociovision lifestyle model was chosen. Sinus Sociovision divides the German population into ten so-called SinusMilieusÒ. Each milieu is described with general values, typical behavioural patterns and socio-demographic data. Microm, a marketing company cooperating with Sinus Sociovision, provides spatially explicit data for the SinusMilieus in Germany. Therefore, the simulation model uses a specific distribution of Sinus-Milieus for each proxel.According to empirical studies conducted within the project GLOWA-Danube, these ten Sinus-Milieus are aggregated to five clusters (Socially Leading Milieus, PostMaterialists, Mainstream, Traditional Milieus, and Hedonistic Milieus) whose characteristics provide the basis for the modelling of the five different Household actor types. Therefore, each inhabited grid cell hosts five Household actors, with each actor representing all households of that specific type. Furthermore, the model applies the framework concept of collaborators to simulate a social network between households: An artificial social network was generated to link similar household types. The specific Household actors take the behaviour of their collaborators into account when deciding upon buying water-related technologies such as rain harvesting systems.

35.The model implementation specialises the base classes of the DEEPACTOR framework as depicted in Fig4. The class DHHActor serves as a base class integrating all Household actors. Household actor types are determined dynamically according to their initially assigned profile. Each proxel contains an actor object for each of the household types existing in this proxel. The amount of households of the same type is a fraction value assigned to the respective actor object.It is computed using the spatial distribution of Sinus-Milieus and the total amount of households imported from the DANUBIA model Demography, which is part of the main component Actor in Fig3. Each Household actor has type-specific characteristics, which stem from various empirical studies undertaken within the project. For each water usage, several plans and their corresponding actions are implemented. The plans have several characteristics, which are important for the decision making of Household actors. For example, characteristics for the decision regarding shower frequency are the amount of water used, the financial costs and the modernity of the plan, representing in how far the specific plan complies with modern hygienic habits such as taking a shower every day. Each plan has a corresponding action, which facilitates the computation of the drinking water demand.

36.Domestic water-use comprises of both habits and deliberate decision making The Household model addresses both kinds of behaviour which can be explained nicely using the example of showering: Shower frequency and length are normally a matter of habit and not of deliberate decision, while the installation of a new showerhead requires a conscious decision process. Habits are chosen in each time step if there are no extraordinary events such as high temperatures or water scarcity. At the same time, households decide consciously upon plans for water-related technologies in each time step. The UML activity diagram in Fig11 provides a high-level overview of the resulting decision procedure.

37.At the beginning of a simulation, the Household model is initialised, providing the Household actors with values for habits, preferences, starting values for water-related technologies, and socio-demographic characteristics. For each time step, all necessary data from other DANUBIA models are imported (getData). Next, the Household model computes the water-related satisfaction and the water demand of the public sector (preCompute). Water-related satisfaction is based upon the level and number of DQN flags. When computing the water demand for the public sector, the model takes the population of the proxels into account. After preCompute, the decisions for all Household actors are calculated by the DHHActor implementation of the abstract framework methods inherited from AbstractActor. Each Household actor perceives its local physical and social environment via its sensors, taking into account air temperature, drinking water price, DQN flags, and the behaviour of its collaborators. Certain events can trigger a deliberate decision for normally habitual behaviours,  a DQN flag on a proxel prompts Household actors on that proxel to make a conscious decision about their showering frequency with a possible reduction of water-use. In this step, every Household actor calculates its deliberate decisions and decides upon water-related technologies. For that, they use two different decision algorithms depending on actor type and technology ( Post-Materialists and Social Leaders are highly motivated and therefore always use a deliberate decision, while Traditional actors only use this kind of decision if they think about buying a rain harvesting system, else they use a simple decision heuristic. Details on the installation of water-related technologies are given in Schwarz and Ernst (in press). Furthermore, actors may decide upon normally habitual behaviour if outer circumstances (as evaluated in options) trigger such a decision. For example, if actors decide upon shower frequency deliberately because of very high air temperatures or water scarcity, they evaluate all plans within the plan group 'shower frequency' (to shower twice a day, once a day, every second day, once a week, or not at all). A Multiattribute Utility approach is used to evaluate these normally habitual behaviours. Situational circumstances ( the level and number of DQN flags in the present and the last time steps) are taken into account by enhancing the importance of single factors entering the decision process ( environmental concerns in the case of DQN flags). Each plan in the plan group executes its corresponding action, which assigns related consequences to the proxel proportionally to the calculated utility value. This step allows every actor to make his behaviour or installation visible to his neighbours and friends. After these computation steps considering the behaviour of the specific Household actors, the main class DHHModel sums up the water demand of all Household actors and the public drinking water demand on a specific proxel to provide both the overall drinking water demand and the amount of waste water produced (postCompute). Finally, the Household model provides this data for other DANUBIA models via its export interface (provide).

38.Applicable results of WaterSupply and Household according to the principle aims of GLOWA-Danube and DANUBIA are outputs that can be used to identify and visualise water supply and consumption-related tendencies and developments in the Upper Danube Basin under conditions of Global Change, based on scenario calculations to: predict the general situation of water supply in the basin (good, stable, endangered, unsafe), identify critical regions and the rate at which critical developments arise (slow, rapid), predict overuse and ecological risks, sketch middle-term trends in water consumption, and to show possible reactions of domestic households to Climate Change. The presentation of the scenario results shows representative clippings that display some of the principles and the capabilities of the developed methodology. Full scenario simulations of the DANUBIA system provide an extremely large amount of outputs in the range of 100 parameters which can each be presented in maps, time series, tables and so forth. The GLOWADanube online Atlas5 provides a platform for all interested in a wider facet of results.

39.The results presented here were obtained by applying the DANUBIA system to three climate scenarios which are explained briefly in Table 3. The 'business as usual scenario' was created using a stochastic procedure to derive long time series of synthetic future climate data6 from measured historical records. To compile a future meteorological data set spanning the next 100 years, the procedure considers measured relations between temperature and rainfall, applies a random variation of temperature, overlays a trend (here 27 K/100a which corresponds to a IPCC B2 scenario), and selects the appropriate time slice from the given basic population of measurements (30 years of DWD (German Weather Service) recordings).It should noted that this methodology has the following disadvantages: reduced representation of autocorrelation, lacking consideration of potential changes in extreme values and an increase of the relative error of determination when approaching the edges of distributions. However, for the present purposes, the advantages clearly dominate: physical consistency of  meteorological input data, meteorological model inputs within a validated range, methodological consistency for ensemble simulations, possible validation versus baseline scenarios; consistent spatial resolution of input data. Fig12 shows a comparison of precipitation, which is the main relevant driver of the system for the three different scenarios described in Table 3.

40.Generally, the following outputs of WaterSupply (amongst others) can be used for further analysis: e Changes to the GQN flag in space and time, indicating changes in natural water availability as a consequence of Global Change.

41.The GQN flags will not be discussed further as they form rather an input to the decisionmaking process of the actors than an output. With respect to the DEEPACTOR approach, the DQN flags are more interesting as they express different behaviour or preferences of WSC actors. The interpretation of changes in the state of the groundwater bodies can vary depending on the sensibility (do they care about the environment or not) of the Water Supply Companies and their willingness to communicate these changes to the water users (household in this case). For the purpose of the demonstration of the model availability to implement different actor's behaviour three exemplary behaviour modes of the WaterSupplyCompanies are shown in Table 4. Although each WSC actor may have different behaviour, for simplicity reasons three scenarios in which all WSC actors behave in the same mode are presented here. The DQN flags are obtained by comparing exerted water demands with the state of the available supplies and maximal withdrawal source capacities on the WSC basis. Beside technical limitations of available sources, the behaviour mode of WSC actors has identified changes to the worse in the available quantity for all three climate scenarios.

42.WSC actors disregard the GQN flag, do not communicate these changes to the water users and try to satisfy water demands by implementing technical measures for greater water extraction without paying any attention to sustainability and ecological issues WSC actors consider changes in natural state of the water resources as very important, communicate these directly to the users and try to identify management options in order to protect the sustainable state of the water resources WSC actors respect environmental aspects in general but behave at the same time pragmatic and economically oriented. It therefore can be seen as a middle (normal) course between the two extremes 'ignorant' and 'sensitive' a prevailing role in the calculation of the DQN flags. Similar to the GQN flags, the DQN flags are presented spatially distributed in snapshot maps from the end of the simulation period and temporarily distributed as time series of aggregated flag values for the three management scenarios. Looking at the average values of the DQN in Fig16, the 'ignorant' behaviour of the WSC causes reporting of constantly 'good' DQN flag values to the water users, which in turns provokes no actions from the user side. The 'middle' and the 'sensitive' behaviour of WSC report the changes in the state of the water resources to the water users, thereby demanding their participation in the identification of the sustainable management solutions. The behaviour of the WSC actor can be expressed through the selection of the different plans. Fig17 summarises the number of WSC that executed a certain plan over the simulation period for the three management scenarios: Fig17 shows that most companies select the Plan 1 (BusinessAsUsual) most of the time. This is directly related to the good state of the water resources in much of the investigation area.It should be noted that the initially predefined water demand and provision of water is higher than the actual water demands exerted on water supply companies. Therefore, the WSC actors must adjust their capacities at the beginning of the simulation, either by selecting Plan 2 ('ExpandCapacities') or Plan 4 ('CrisisManagement'). For the few WSC actors that do not have enough potential sources to expand, Plan 4 remains the only option.In these cases, the use of Plan 4 does not indicate the real water stress in the area but is a consequence of data unavailability regarding existing water supply capacities. These initial increases of the available capacity proved to be enough for the provision of enough water throughout the rest of the simulation period. The changes in the availability of the water resources are small enough to be satisfied from the existing technical capacities and only small upgrades have been identified as necessary (small variations in the selection of Plan 1 and Plan 2).

43.The Household model also provides a large variety of result data on various aggregation levels, seasonal changes of water demand within the catchment showing reactions of households to air temperature; discontinuous changes of water demand due to DQN flags, stemming from both changing, formerly habitual waterrelated behaviour and an enhanced installation of watersaving technologies; continuous changes of water demand due to the installation of water-related innovations, leading to a slight reduction of water demanddthese changes can be tracked back to the various actor types showing different adoption of these innovations. With the three chosen climate scenarios and the three different water supply management scenarios, the number of scenarios ('storylines') from the viewpoint of the domestic water users represented by the Household model is nine. For that reason the following discussion of the results will be based on the business as usual scenario, which is assumed to be the most consistent and likely climate scenario.In order to emphasise the interaction between the models WaterSupply and Household, population and water prices were kept constant for all simulation runs. The main driving forces for the Household model are the DQN flags from the WaterSupply model and the air temperature, which are shown in Fig18.According to the strategy chosen by the water supply companies, domestic Households are confronted with different levels of public awareness regarding water availability (in Fig18 shown as the average value of the DQN flag for the whole catchment).In the scenario 'ignorant', almost no communication of problems in water availability takes place, while in the scenario 'sensitive' nearly constant communication regarding these issues can be detected throughout the simulated area.In the scenario 'middle', which, from the three water supply management scenarios is probably the most likely one, the communication between WSC and Household remains in average on a very low level between 'no problems reported' and 'newspaper reports'. A climax can be observed in the 2020ies, a period much dryer than average. The resulting domestic drinking water demand is spatially explicit, indicating high demands in Munich (agglomeration in the centre of the catchment) and a few larger cities.In Germany, domestic water use and small business water consumption are combined to one value in the official statistics. Therefore, one finds a higher per capita water demand in urban than in rural areas which does not necessarily mean that people in big cities consume more water. When exploring temporal dynamics, domestic water demand clearly shows seasonal changes in all scenario runs, mostly due to increased showering with higher air temperatures.In addition, discontinuous variability in water demand can be detected. Differences in domestic drinking water demand between the scenarios 'ignorant' and 'sensitive' and between 'ignorant' and 'middle'(see lower lines of Fig20) are reactions to the different scenarios of DQN flags provided by WaterSupply. This variability is due to the reaction of households to DQN flags: Households perceive flags and interpret them as newspaper articles, appeals to save water or even restrictions on water use. According to their characteristics, households (1) reduce their water demand by constricting shower frequency, bathing or cleaning, (2) are further encouraged to buy water-saving technologies. Over the years, the water demand decreases. This is the result of two factors. First, the simulated water scarcity results in some regions in a reduced drinking water demand because Household actors lower their water use in response to the DQN flag. The second and main reason is the installation of more water-efficient technologies (water-saving showerheads, toilet tanks, and washing machines).In the scenario runs, water-saving technologies further diffuse in the catchment area, rain harvesting systems almost double from about % to 12% not install rain harvesting systems at all if there are no problems in water scarcity.

44.The development of validation strategies is a research topic of its own within GLOWA-Danube and will not be treated here in depth. Generally, within fully integrated and multidisciplinary systems such as DANUBIA, the objective of validation cannot be the validation of single models or even single process descriptions alone but more the validation of the coupled system as a whole. Here we will not discuss the validation of natural science models, which follows in principle the traditional 'comparison observedsimulated' approach,7 but the validation options for results of the DEEPACTOR models in the socio-economic sector. For the socio-economic models within the actor component data that can be used for validation is generally less accurate, meaningful and reliable than equivalent data that can be used in the natural science sector. Typical socio-economic model output variables would for example be domestic water consumption (model Household), household income (Economy), crop yields/prices (Farming), population (Demography) overnight stays (Tourism) and groundwater withdrawal (WaterSupply). Regarding observed values for these data two main problems exist: (a) The spatial and temporal accuracy of the available observed data is low and data are often unreliable (agricultural statistics are on district level so that values relate to areas of 1000e5000 km2 and are mainly based on random sampling, domestic water consumption is collected on a community level annually and no distinction is made between domestic and small business consumption).(b) Much 'socio-economic' data are not available to the public or are very difficult to obtain. Data are not collected systematically on a countrywide level, but on a 'problem oriented' basis, for certain areas and for certain periods only. The results of such data collections may be stored at various locations (private companies, authorities on different levels) and are subject to data protection. Finally, much data are privately owned. With respect to the DEEPACTOR approach and its model implementations WaterSupply and Household described in this article, data belonging to the categories described above is only interesting for the intermediate level of results. More interesting would be data that can directly be related to the results which are relevant with respect to the main objectives of these models, results that can directly be used for decision making or in stakeholder discussion. Interesting results of this category would be the DQN flag or the water-related satisfaction of domestic consumers. As was shown in the previous sections, such results are highly influenced by the preferences and options that were assigned to the respective actors. Unfortunately little is known about the 'behaviour' of water supply companies or the development of water consumption behaviour under conditions of Global Change.It is therefore very difficult to validate the respective model results in a traditional way. This general problem of socio-economic models that rely on a large degree on assumption about actor responses to change is amplified in the Upper Danube Catchment because problems with water quantity have been almost unknown during the last 2e3 decades and water availability problems from earlier periods cannot be compared to the current situation because the infrastructure has been extended considerably since this time. As a result, many important outputs of DANUBIA, in particular from the socio-economic sector, cannot be validated in the classical sense on the basis of measured data. The only means for validation is to include expert knowledge and consumer experiences, the judgement from water supply company managers, local water authorities or consumer opinions collected using questionnaires.In order to use such soft data, it is necessary to use transparent, process-based models. Only then can subjective and uncertain parameters of the calculation be meaningfully discussed and adjusted according to the advice of local experts. Again it must be pointed out that the socio-economic DEEPACTOR models' outputs depend directly on the natural science models outputs and therefore inherit the respective models' errors and uncertainties. The DANUBIA system as a whole relies to a large degree on the quality and uncertainty of the drivers, foremost the climate scenarios. The scenarios used should therefore be regarded as a variety of possible futures and the simulation results therefore as a way to explore ranges of possible developments within the boundaries of such future scenarios. The results are not predictions and the DSS DANUBIA does not propose solutions but rather provides a basis for discussing potentially upcoming problems and the keys to avoid or manage them. The means of validation that can be applied are often indirect and not of numerical type. The first validation option is the comparison of intermediate results to observed values. In the case of the Household model, this would be for example the domestic drinking water demand (per community).In the case of the WaterSupply model, it would be the groundwater withdrawal (per source). The matches between modelled and observed groundwater withdrawal rates for example are reasonably good but with limitations that can be contributed to the weak data availability and the large scale of the models. Second, with respect to the flag values, where no measured values exist, model simulations for the reference period 1970 to 2003 can be compared to verbal descriptions of the state of groundwater resources and the water supply system in the literature.In the case of the upper Danube Catchment, such evaluations are rather general, yet valuable for the parameterisation and a comparison of the model results for 'normal' periods. For such 'normal situations' and 'normal behaviour' of the actors in the past, model results of the hydrological models and subsequently the WaterSupply model show a good status of groundwater resources and an optimal performance of the water supply system if a 'normal' behaviour of the water supply companies is assumed. On the other hand, if rather drastic climatic conditions are forced problems develop in exactly those regions with unsuitable hydrological conditions that are outlined by the administrative groundwater reports mentioned above. For such water scarcity situations, the extremely hot and dry years 1976 and 2003 can be used for reference.In those years ecological (rivers, wetlands) and economical (navigation, hydropower) damage and some short-term, local water scarcity in parts of the catchment could be observed. Reports on these events form a valuable basis for the parameterisation and further discussion of models and approaches. Finally, for the validation of 'behaviour', telephone interviews with 1026 randomly selected households were carried out. The interviews were based on the results of a questionnaire sent to 1000 households in a smaller test area earlier on. More than 2000 questionnaires were sent to WaterSupply companies. The questionnaire results formed valuable information to develop the models but will not be further discussed here.

46.The hydrological cycle is a complex system, playing an important role for many human activities.In turn many human activities affect and change the hydrological cycle significantly. A main challenge is the fact that human activities adapt to change and can therefore not be represented as static, repetitive processes. What is needed is a certain degree of ability to react to changes by making decisions that are not predefined by trivial input/output functions. In GLOWADanube, the DEEPACTOR approach and its generic implementation, the DEEPACTOR framework, were developed to tackle this challenge. The framework provides a common conceptual and architectural basis for the development of the socio-economic simulation models in the coupled simulation system of DANUBIA. A very important aspect hereby is the integration of decision makers, stakeholders and experts. Models that provide multidisciplinary results and show the interdependencies of the relevant processes are helpful tools to foster this integration. Models in that context should not necessarily be seen as the tools that provide the management solutions but as means to raise awareness of how natural and social systems interact and what the social, environmental and economic costs of human interference with the natural system are. A main challenge thereby is to find the balance between an appropriate, realistic and accurate representation of multifaceted, complex natural and social systems on the one hand, and on the other hand to provide results that satisfy the demands of disciplinary experts as well as the demands of stakeholders and decision makers in all required fields.

47.The DEEPACTOR framework as an object-oriented extension is a specialisation of the DANUBIA developer framework.Its design follows the specific requirements for an 'agent-based' social simulation approach as given by the socio-economic simulation models of GLOWA-Danube. Along this line, the framework provides a common generic architecture, a modelling framework with a multitude of basic, but mostly optional, features to be used within the implementation of the concrete simulation models. An important architectural aspect is the explicit modelling of actor, plan and action. Even though in the case of the Household model, the actors' types are designated only implicitly by an assigned profile, there are explicit subclasses for plan and action types providing a direct representation of the conceptual course-of-actions. In the case of the WaterSupply model, there are two actor types explicitly distinguished by their available plans and their type-specific decision procedure.In both model applications the direct and explicit modelling of types (subclasses) provides both a clear specification of the current model structure and the possibility for incremental modular extensions in future model versions. The flexibility of the framework design is illustrated by the quite different model implementations Household and WaterSupply. For example, both simulation models make use of the basic actor features location and collaborators, but, in the case of the WaterSupply model, the actors are located on more than one proxel, whereas the Household actors are defined as one per type (milieu) and proxel object. The collaborators of WaterSupply actors model 'real' collaborators of a WSC for providing water, whereas collaborators of Household actors are used to simulate an artificial social network and the diffusion of water-related technologies. From a more general point of view, the application of the DEEPACTOR approach is advantageous for the water supply sector because it facilitates a flexible and realistic response to system changes. Scenarios can be defined easily by adjusting actor types and preferences; critical states can be identified without having to model the infrastructure of individual WSC explicitly. Moreover, the modular and extendable model structure enables participatory model design and simulation, as explained and discussed  in Ramanath and Gilbert, providing an effective tool for analysing effects of different course-of-actions of water supply companies with respect to response to Global Change scenarios.In contrast, the simulation model of water-related behaviour of domestic households does not aim to provide adjustable parameters in the context of a realistic and direct model of environmental circumstances. Rather in this case the application facilitates the bottomup approach to social modelling. Based upon the data provided by Sinus Sociovision, the model enables the explanation of observable macro phenomena with a low resolution of type dependent decision algorithms and local rules for social network generation, both formulated on the proxel-level. Therefore, in contrast to a purely equation-based model, the model can be more easily communicated to stakeholders and is, in general, more comprehensible due to the conceptually and technically explicit model structure. Finally, the embedding into DANUBIA as an extension of an already existing abstract base class allows benefiting from the treatment of (a) the simulation area as a grid of proxel objects, (b) its method and mechanism for data exchange during runtime via formally specified interfaces and (c) its concept of simulation time with a consistent dynamic integration of model-specific time steps. As a consequence any DEEPACTOR model may be executed and coupled to any other DANUBIA simulation model completely transparent for the rest of the system.In fact, this integration is one of the reasons not to build on existing toolkits such as Repast, MASON or Swarm.It would be by far not trivial and even confusing to embed them into DANUBIA, since the particular base classes and modelling elements usually are more general, having their own notions and concepts of simulation area, time and data exchange, of concepts which are fixed in DANUBIA.In summary the DEEPACTOR framework and also the developer framework of DANUBIA can be seen to be more special cases of general frameworks developed elsewhere. Both have been designed and implemented with focus on the requirements of the simulation models of GLOWADanube. We belief that this approach is most promising since it seems to be an appropriate compromise between generality and specificsdit provides starting points without restricting to much and it restricts enough to allow for useful generic implementations on the framework level.

48.The two models chosen can only partially represent the complex processes and structures that determine the patterns of water supply and consumption in a large heterogeneous domain such as the Upper Danube catchment. The current model implementations should be regarded as preliminary versions to test and show the capabilities of the approach. The models are not yet fully validated and not all options offered by the DEEPACTOR framework are used.In that respect, the greatest advantage of the approach lies in the fact that it is easily extendable in terms of plans, actions, preferences and so forth in a consistent way without the need of significant changes to the model structure. This was demonstrated for example by assigning different reaction schemes of water supply companies toward change state of groundwater resources. Our results have been discussed from two points of view. First, we evaluated and compared the application of the DEEPACTOR approach and the DEEPACTOR framework, respectively, by means of the models WaterSupply and Household. Second, we briefly presented domain-specific results of a scenario simulation, primarily to illustrate the functionality of the coupled models WaterSupply and Household within DANUBIA.In addition to the specific outcome of the models (DQN flags and domestic water demand), the chosen plans and actions of actors as underlying mechanisms were analysed.It was shown on hand of a very limited choice of results that both models provide a spatially and temporally explicit, process based way of simulation response of main actors in the water sector to Global Change. They show very clearly where and when undesirable developments might occur in a relatively simple way that allows for an easy detection and explanation of causeeeffect relations. Rather than forming black boxes, the processes leading to system changes are controlled by a limited set of intuitively understandable preferences, options and triggers of model actors that are simplified but still very similar to the actors in the real world. The results are therefore very well suited to form a basis for active participation of decision makers and stakeholders in coming to discussions of how we should prepare for possible developments which may be brought upon by Global Change.

49.The decision support system DANUBIA and the DEEPACTOR approach presented in this article are a compromise between the size and the complexity of heterogeneous natural systems in large catchments, the complexity of human behaviour, the high degree of inherent uncertainty in both natural systems and human society and the need to realistically and meaningfully evaluate the impact of Global Change on the environment and human welfare. The aim of DANUBIA is to describe the water cycle and its physical and socioeconomic components as a whole and not so much to describe individual sectoral processes. Experts from different disciplines may therefore find the representation of their discipline over-simplified. DANUBIA was developed for use on a very high administrative level (governmental institutions on state, country or river basin level), where knowledge, data and financial resources to set up and run the required models are available.It was developed as a generic system that is transferable and reusable but not necessarily scalable.It can be applied everywhere, but an application must be based on a high-level political decision and respective financial resources to allow its implementation, since the volume of data and financial resources needed to parameterise the individual models are quite extensive. An application to smaller scale 'test case studies' is technically possible but largely meaningless since it contradicts the regional scope of the approach.
