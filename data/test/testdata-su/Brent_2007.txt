2.This paper focuses on the application of the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) technique in the context of sustainable development to establish and optimise health care waste management (HCWM) systems in rural areas of developing countries. This is achieved by evaluating the way in which the AHP can best be combined with a life cycle management (LCM) approach, and addressing a main objective of HCWM systems, to minimize infection of patients and workers within the system. The modified approach was applied to two case studies: the sub-Saharan African countries of South Africa and Lesotho. Quantitative weightings from the AHP are used to identify alternative systems that have similar outcomes in meeting the systems objective, but may have different cost structures and infection risks. The two case studies illustrate how the AHP can be used (with strengths and weaknesses) in environmental engineering decision support in developing countries.

3.This paper focuses on the application of the analytical hierarchy process(AHP) to address a specific sustainable development problem in developing countries, to minimise infection risks of health care waste management (HCWM) systems. Therefore, the AHP technique is introduced shortly with its strengths and weaknesses, and the application thereof is considered in the context of sustainable development and HCWM, to clarify the specific objectives of the study. The AHP is a known multiattribute weighting method for decision support. As such, the AHP has been used for solving complex decision-making problems in various disciplines, public policy, strategic planning, viability determination, forecasting, and project management. The AHP, which follows an approach of pair-wise comparison, provides a way for calibrating a numerical scale, particularly in new areas where measurements and quantitative comparisons do not exist. The process is summarised in .A number of benefits and limitations have been noted with the AHP process in general as a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) technique.

4.The concept of sustainability and sustainable development2 can be understood intuitively, but it remains difficult to express it in concrete, operational terms. However, many agree that sustainable development is about achieving environmental, economic, and social welfare for present as well as future generations.

5.Consistency is a statistical measure of the extent to which an individual's decision structure, set of assessment judgements, is closer to being logically related than randomly chosen. The consistency of judgements reflects the extent to which the decision maker(s) understands the problem, is knowledgeable of the decision variables involved, understands the assessment process, and is able to make a series of logically related judgements based on uncertain and often incomplete information. Sustainable development has been defined as – development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

6.From a governmental perspective this can be at national and global levels. From an organizational perspective this can be at a project level.In some cases stakeholders specifically require that environmental, economic, and social goals must be met across all levels of development. Sustainable development has subsequently been conceptualised as a state of dynamic equilibrium between societal demand for a preferred development and the supply of environmental and economic goods and services needed to meet this demand. Systems approaches have been proposed to consider strategic sustainable development planning in different sectors. But the intricate relationships between the three dimensions of sustainable development, environmental, economic and social welfare, have been difficult to model within the concept of a clear absolute system. Specifically, trade-offs between the three dimensions of sustainable development may not be possible to quantify as the benefits cannot be measured. Proposals for these trade-offs can be referred to as 'weak', indirectly indicating sustainability.

7.Consensus on the general objectives and basic principles of sustainable development may be obtained in theory. But consensus on the details of how to achieve sustainable development or maintain sustainability is difficult to obtain in practice. This difficulty can be attributed to the variety of perceptions on specific socio-cultural and political contexts that change over time. For example, very high inconsistencies in the judgements of panels with regards to strategic sustainability assessments have been documented. This is most probably an inherent weakness of the AHP when it is applied without support data in the context of sustainable development. This weakness is highlighted in developing countries by the difficulties to establish operable systems and to obtain support data that can be measured against sustainable development criteria such as the principles proposed in Agenda 21.3.Regardless, the AHP has been used before for the purposes of assessing and weighting criteria and indicators for sustainable development in specific applications.

8.Sustainable development and health care waste management (HCWM) systems Health care is a basic need for current and future generations, and is therefore one of the objectives of sustainable development systems.In developing countries the main symptom of poor health is the high mortality rate due to infectious diseases4 with the accompanying reduced life expectancy. For example, in Lesotho the life expectancy for women is 40 and for men 35. The main objective identified of Health Care Waste Management (HCWM) systems in South Africa and Lesotho is to prevent the spread of infections from the health care waste to the workers and the community. This compares with the first objective of health care systems in general: 'first do no harm'. Although data on the spread of infections due to waste handling is limited, experts accept that 5% of all HIV infections in Africa are due to unsafe injections, of which unsafe waste disposal is a component. Surveys of rural primary health care facilities indicate that needle pricks occur in the work place. The probability of infection due to needle prick is higher for hepatitis than for HIV.

9.The HCWM system can be seen as a sub-system of the health care system. Therefore, optimizing efficiency of the waste management system, although not a guarantee for improvement in health care systems, is a component of sustainable development in such systems.

10.The balancing of tradeoffs between the three dimensions of sustainable development, environment, economy, and society, may not be so difficult when a systems approach is taken to HCWM. Therefore, it can be argued that 'strong sustainability' criteria can be identified for waste management systems, a direct relationship between action and sustainability response.

13.Health care systems can be described quantitatively using standardized systems tools, such as the life cycle assessment tool. LCA is incorporated in the ISO 14000 family of standards and is based on inventories of materials and quantification of adverse impacts. Such tools allow the use of a number of quantitative approaches, mass flow analysis, and life cycle costing. Thereby, assessments can be made to identify how to develop more sustainable systems providing that the information is available. These assessments are difficult to perform in the developed world and there is, as yet, no consensus on a consistent methodology to measure these causes or effects. This is highlighted in the ongoing work of the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) workgroup of the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) global life cycle initiative.In the developing world there is often not enough quantitative information to follow these types of formalised methodologies.In the developing country context, the availability of technology can also be seen to be a major limitation to introducing safe HCWM systems. Developing countries often do not have support systems to install, maintain, and operate developed world environmental technologies. The sustainable approach is to accommodate the use of more environmentally sound technologies (ESTs)5 in the design of the waste management system. These ESTs are safer than the technologies they replace and more suited to the economic, social, and environmental conditions of the developing country, which can be contextually unique. A checklist for the identification of ESTs is as follows.

14.In the absence of quantitative data on impacts and descriptions of systems capability to use ESTs in developing countries, a process is required by which the priorities can be set to establish safer systems. Application of the AHP as decision support for the sustainable development of health care waste management (HCWM) systems The complexities of health care waste management (HCWM) systems result from the many possible combinations of options, or alternatives, apart from singular technologies. However, when multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) models, such as the AHP, are used to consider waste management options, the models identified in the literature only take into account waste once generated. Waste prevention, waste minimisation, or product design for the environment, which would eliminate the production of materials that cannot be reused, recycled, or naturally biodegraded, are generally not considered.

16.A case study research methodology was followed to evaluate the application of the AHP to HCWM systems. Case study methodology is preferred in examining contemporary events, and adding direct observations and systematic interviewing makes case studies more relevant than other strategies. However, a common concern about case studies is that they provide very little basis for scientific generalisation. The case studies consisted of two workshops in South Africa and Lesotho, with participants from the respective HCWM systems, where the AHP was applied. Therefore, the outcomes of this study are applicable in the Southern African context, but may not be correct for developing countries in other regions of the world. The implications of this research approach were that four quality data tests, which have been noted as important, had to be verified. These tests, together with the associated techniques followed were:Primary health care facilities, in the developing country context, are defined as facilities at and from which a range of primary health care services are provided, but inpatient services are typically not provided.It is normally open only 8 hours a day. Certain staff may, however, be required to sleep at or near the clinic so that they are available on call in case of emergency.

18.The two workshops stretched over one and two days, for South Africa and Lesotho, respectively.It has been stated that the size of an assessment panel depends on the objectives of the assessment, resources, and time available. As little as 10 participants are sufficient. This panel should comprise stakeholders, facilitators, and experts, although the level of expertise need not be the same as long as all participants are familiar with the problem. Furthermore, to focus the AHP process it has been advised to engage a small group of participants. In the case of the South African and Lesotho workshops, 11 individuals participated over the full duration of the workshops that represent different operational levels in the respective HCWM systems: • Strategic planning, occupational health, environment, and technical government officials and public–private specialists; • Implementation planning, infection control, and technical government officials and public– private specialists; and • Implementation, health inspectors, and waste management technical specialists.

Less participants represented non-governmental organizations and the private sector involved with the HCWM systems of the countries. However, the main problem with the under serviced rural primary health care facilities lies with the national Departments of Health and it is the responsibility under the Health Acts in both countries that the respective departments are responsible to ensure minimum treatment standards are achieved in both public and private sectors. Therefore, a larger representation of the public sector is appropriate for these cases.

23.The nominal group technique was used in this part of the process. This was in pursuit of reaching a cohesive understanding for the whole group. Although it has been argued that aggregating assessment data without examining individual differences may lead to a false sense of group consensus, the aggregate of a group will provide results that are superior to those of an individual. Furthermore, there is a synergistic effect to aggregating individual judgments. The hierarchical trees of attributes and options for HCWM systems were constructed prior to the workshops using national experts and survey data. The trees were presented on flip charts when doing the comparisons of the different attributes and options. Two session leaders and an assistant conducted this process, as has been suggested. The panel of participants reached an agreement to alter the attributes and options to suit the South African and Lesotho context. A computer terminal was also set up to consolidate the results as they were generated.It also helped the facilitators to identify inconsistency in the individual set of comparisons. Members of the panel could then be urged to alter their weighting factors in the case of poor consistency ratios.

However, in many developing countries, these standards are not available, in which case available options can be identified and ranked by national technical experts. Decision-makers of waste management practices at district level, who have the ultimate responsibility according to the South African regulations, can identify alternative systems based on combinations of these options for each life cycle phase.

27-6.Decision-makers of waste management practices at district level, who have the ultimate responsibility according to the South African regulations, can identify alternative systems based on combinations of these options for each life cycle phase.

28.Databases have also been developed to provide examples of practical options for the life cycle phases. Although some of these options have been standardised, actual practices differ widely, which is due to choices based on the availability of working equipment, and financial resources, and training. The consequences of these choices are different levels of risk in terms of health impact due to various pathways to infection of health care workers, patients, and the public in general from the infectious waste, hepatitis B and HIV/AIDS via needle stick. The infection risks have been identified and assessed for certain options relating to treatment devices in terms of the procedure at the point where the health care waste is generated. However, infection risks have not been assessed for the options for rural primary health care facilities for the other life cycle phase components. The approach followed here was to use expert opinion to place weights (in terms of infection risks, which are seen as the highest potential impact) on these options in the developing country context. These weights were used to compare alternatives for the four life cycle phases and to identify the alternative(s) with the minimum perceived infection risk. Ranking of the alternatives assists decisionmakers to select the best available combination of options for the components of an entire HCWM system in a specific region. Correlating AHP and waste life cycle management terminology From the above it is necessary to correlate the different terminologies of the two decision support tools, if AHP is to be used to establish the (perceived) health risks associated with each option available for a life cycle phase component at rural primary health care facilities. The use of the AHP terms depends on the type of hierarchical tree and its application. Table 2 defines the terms of AHP when applied as part of the WasteOpt model.

39.Again, in the context of waste LCM, the overall objectives are to minimise the risk of infection at a clinic for a specific life cycle phase, and an alternative is therefore a combination of component options for each of the four main life cycle phases that can be chosen to minimise the overall risk of a HCWM system.

30.The conventional AHP protocol requires that the elements be clustered into homogenous groups so they can meaningfully be compared with other elements in the level.It is also required that any element in one level must be capable of being related to some element in the next higher level.In a typical AHP the first level is the overall goal of the decisionmaker. The second level consists of factors that contribute to the goal, while the third level denotes the alternatives available for application. Due to the fact that the factors in second level relate to a specific life cycle phase, individual hierarchies were constructed for each phase separately, as opposed to a single hierarchy for the entire system. Through the hierarchies, decisionmakers are thereby enabled to select the preferred alternative for each life cycle phase. Options were identified for the life cycle components (of the phases) of waste systems at typical primary health care clinics in rural areas, and structured into the appropriate levels. These hierarchy trees are shown in of Appendix A.

32.Minimise infections risks for each essential life cycle phase Essential life cycle phase components, and associated options Combination of life cycle phase component options reflects the level of technological development, South Africa has a more developed infrastructure. For this reason the South African group was in general agreement with the initially compiled life cycle phase components and associated options, whereas the group of participants of the Lesotho workshop made two major changes to the. Options for the on-site disposal life cycle phase: The comparison for transport options was removed due to the argument that at the disposal site no transportation is practiced. The transport options for the treatment activity apply for the disposal activity as well, and a pit latrine was also considered to be a form of a controlled dump. Options for central treatment activity: The incinerator technology comparisons were restricted to multi-chamber incinerator (MCI) and singlechamber incinerator (SCI) options. The consensus was reached by the group of experts and was justified by the fact that although the other techniques are in consideration for the country they have not been applied. Encapsulation treatment was also excluded because it was regarded as a stabilization method, which brought no change to the composition of the waste; it was therefore not considered a treatment method.

33.The AHP results of questionnaires for the two workshops are summarised in Tables 4–9 of Appendix A. The tables highlight where individual participants were inconsistent within sets of comparisons. The original expectation was that a 10% consistency ratio (CR) is required for valid results.It has been suggested that consistency is particularly difficult when decision-makers consider sustainable development aspects. However, for a 95% confidence interval, the median CR can be up to 12% when dealing with a panel of multiple experts. Therefore, for these case studies, CRs of less than 12% were considered as an adequate indication of consistency. The CRs of 12% and higher are bold in the tables of Appendix A. The tables further show the average CRs for the individuals for all life cycle phase components, as well as the geometric mean, average, and standard deviations for the two groups for each set of comparisons. The calculations of the group average CRs only include those participants that were consistent in each set of comparisons, the CRs were less than 0.012. The geometric mean weights for the different life cycle phase components and options, for the South African workshop, are summarised in the figures of Appendix A.

34.The allocated time for the facilitation and coordination of the workshop process as a key issue in developing countries. The number of individual inconsistencies, when comparing the results of the two workshops in the tables of Appendix A, highlights the importance of the workshop process. The length of time allocated to an AHP-dedicated workshop is of major importance. Because of the difficulty in keeping groups of people together, only one or two days for decision analysing are considered achievable. For example, in the Lesotho workshop additional people arrived on the second day and some left after the first day. The one day that was allowed for the South African workshop, compared to the two days allocated to the Lesotho workshop, influenced the • Time available for group discussions and subsequent consensus within sub-groups and the whole group in some cases; and • The number of iterations; where inconsistencies were detected during the Lesotho workshop, subsequent iterations could be undertaken after further discussion, which has been shown to dramatically improve the CRs.In another study where sustainable development aspects had to be weighted (Mulder and Brent, in press), up to 5 days were required to reach good individual consistency within a panel of experts in a developing country context. This points to other limitations when applying the AHP.

35.There were diverse participants in the two workshops, managers and implementers. The implementers at district level participated to acquire specific knowledge while the national managers argued at a higher level since they have more knowledge of the HCWM systems in general. The implementers were found to be 'black or white' thinkers while the national experts perceived 'grey' areas. The implementers subsequently formed subgroups and could reach consensus amongst them, while the national planners differed in opinions and tended not to reach consensus in groups. The ranking within the AHP by some national planners was taken as a separate judgement call for each comparison, instead of a judgement ranking within a set of comparisons. Therefore this level of participants tended to see discrete sets of options within an attribute option set.It was found to be very difficult to communicate this aspect of the AHP to the group at large.In these cases discussions between the workshop facilitators and individuals were required to inform participants of inconsistencies and how these come about, which, again, required additional time. Some of the participants performed the ranking with pre-conceived ideas, which also negatively influenced consistencies within sets of comparisons.It is subsequently believed that direct weighing is easier and more relevant than pair-wise comparisons for these types of participants. Some participants thought the conventional AHP scale of 1–9 was too small and did not allow them to allocate numbers properly.In contrast the scale confused other participants such that they mixed the left and the right hand sides of the scale when confronted by the comparison question, which option is more important, and by how much, to minimise infection risks. Furthermore, precision errors with the conventional AHP scale and eigenvector approach have been noted in literature, and the precision level of each of the comparisons cannot be guaranteed. For these reasons the spread of priority weights is rather large for some of the hierarchical tree attributes, which has been shown to be characteristic of the application of AHP to sustainable development. Considering the standard deviation and mean values in the tables of Appendix A, large spreads are more pronounced for the life cycle phase components than the associated specific options of components. This highlights the difficulty for the multiple decision-making panels to achieve consistent ranking of items on the upper levels of the hierarchical trees.

36.The overall weights for alternatives, the combination of option choices for the essential life cycle phase components, were obtained with the conventional AHP by multiplication of the priority weight of each component option by the priority weight of the associated life cycle phase component. Table 9 provides, as an example, the waste generation life cycle phase using the South African workshop data. Determining priority from a safety perspective through the following equation has translated this ranking into impact indicators of the risk of each alternative for a life cycle phase.

38.A model is introduced that incorporates the standardised life cycle management (LCM) approach with the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), whereby health care waste management (HCWM) systems can be optimised in developing countries. The AHP was used to assign priorities to the alterna tives in the life cycle of waste according to the infection risks associated with the life cycle component options that are available to decision-makers in the life cycle of waste. Thereby, alternatives, or combinations of options for essential components of a HCWM system were ranked according to the respective combined risks in relation to best practices for that developing country context. Also, allocations of resources for the implementation of these priorities can be assigned in short and medium terms based on availabilities of resources and largest benefit. Therefore waste management systems can be optimized within the sustainability requirements of stakeholder acceptance, national safety requirements, and available system resources. Two case studies were used to apply the AHP as part of the model. The case studies consisted of workshops that were held with stakeholders of the HCWM systems in South Africa and Lesotho.
