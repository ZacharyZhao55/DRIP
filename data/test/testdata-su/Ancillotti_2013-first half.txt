1.The term smart grid is commonly used to refer to a modernized electrical system, in which new and more sustainable models of energy production, distribution and usage will be made possible by incorporating in the power system: (a) pervasive communication and monitoring capabilities, and (b) more distributed and autonomous control and management functionalities . As a matter of fact existing electric grids are a largescale, unidirectional and centralized systems in which the electricity is delivered from remote power plants through a tree-based distribution system to local customers with preestablished load profiles . However, a number of technological innovations, as well as environmental and economical concerns, have emerged in the last decade that have made traditional electric power systems outdated and not well suited to meet the reliability, efficiency and sustainability requirements posed by those changes.

3.From a practical point of view the above vision requires the pervasive deployment of ‘‘intelligent’’ devices  (, sensors, actuators, smart appliances, smart meters, embedded computers, )that are capable of collecting real-time and fine-grained information about electricity usage patterns, as well as about the status of distributed energy resources and other components of the electric grid. This huge amount of heterogeneous information collected by the metering and monitoring infrastructures that will be incorporated in a smart grid must be shared in a reliable and secure manner to a multitude of distributed energy management systems. These systems are responsible for analyzing the received data, predicting and detecting possible issues (, failures, energy shortages, disturbances), and making decisions to control and optimize the operations of the power system. Note that most of these management and control functions will be executed in response to local events but they may have an impact on the resiliency and efficiency of large portions of the electric grid.

4.To support information collection, distribution and analysis, as well as automated control and optimization of the power system, we argue that the smart grid communication system will rely on two major subsystems: a communication infrastructure and a middleware platform. The communication infrastructure consists of a set of communication technologies, networks and protocols that: (i) support communication connectivity amongst devices or grid sub-systems, and (ii) enable the distribution of information and commands within the power system. As better explained in the following, basic requirements for such communication infrastructure are scalability, reliability, timeliness and security. The middleware platform consists of a software layer, which is situated between the applications and the underlying communication infrastructure, providing the services needed to build efficient distributed functions and systems. Specifically, a middleware runs on the devices that are part of the smart grid communication infrastructure to support: (i) data management services (, data sharing, storage, and processing), (ii) standard communication and programming interfaces for distributed applications, and (iii) computational intelligence and autonomic management capabilities. Furthermore, it is of paramount importance to ensure secure and reliable operations of the smart grid communication system to protect the entire smart grid. However, security solutions can not be confined to a single component of the smart grid communication system but security is a cross-layer issue because it is equally important to: (i) secure devices, information, and services, (ii) preserve data integrity, confidentiality and authenticity, and (iii) ensure very high availability of electricity provision. Then, the purpose of this survey is to provide a general reference architecture of the smart grid communication system and its major components. We utilize our reference model to identify basic system requirements and key technologies, with special focus on communication technologies and protocols, data management services, autonomic control functions and security mechanisms. Furthermore, this survey provides a comprehensive and up-to-date survey of state-of-the-art solutions for each of the above research challenges, and we discuss advantages and shortcomings of each proposed technique. Finally, we also identify main open issues and future research directions.

5.It is important to point out that other surveys exist targeting various aspects of smart grids. There are a number of positional papers that focus on explaining what makes an electric grid a smart grid. Those papers have the purpose of setting a common background and vision about smart grids, and to specify roadmaps and guidelines for the development of smart grids . Other surveys have investigated the communication networks for smart grids in terms of requirements, enabling technologies and possible network architectures .In  the research challenges for smart grid communications are analyzed from an industrial perspective in terms of interoperability, scalability and security.

8.The essential purpose of an electric grid is to deliver electricity to customers, which are the termination points of the power distribution system.In the early days of electricity distribution, electric grids were isolated systems in which electric power was produced by small generators using direct current (DC). However, DC-based electricity could only be transmitted over short distances due to power line losses. With the advent of alternating current (AC) at the end of the 19th century it was possible to distribute electricity over long distances using high voltages more efficiently than with DC. Then, rapid industrialization, urbanization and economic development required the deployment of large-scale infrastructures for electricity delivery, which were operated through national monopolies. The structure of those national electric grids has remained (almost) unchanged till nowadays, and it consists of three main components: (1) generation, (2) transmission and (3) distribution .

9.In a traditional power grid, the generation sub-system relies on a small number of large power plants using conventional (coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear) resources to produce electricity. Then, high-voltage transmission lines, which form the transmission network, are used to transfer electricity across long distances from power plants to electric substations. A substation includes transformers to change voltage levels from high transmission voltages to lower distribution voltages. Furthermore, substations perform several other important functions, such as grid protection and power control. Substations, medium- and low-voltage power lines, and electric meters form the distribution network.It is important to point out that a power system must be engineered such that electricity production always matches electricity demands. This implies that any change in power demands should be accommodated through an equal change in power supply. To deal with unexpected peak demands special power generators are deployed in existing power grids, which have very short start-up delays. Note that battery technologies are still expensive and inefficient, thus energy storage systems cannot be employed on a large scale to mitigate the impact of sudden load changes and fluctuations. Even if electric utilities keep generation capacity in reserves that can be accessed quickly, electricity imbalances are still possible for a number of reasons, and existing power systems may suffer from grid instabilities and power outages. Furthermore, as power grids are complex highly interconnected systems, a failure at one location can easily trigger a cascade effect that could result into regional blackouts, such as in the case of the Northeast US and Canada blackouts of 1965 and 2003 .

10.To improve the reliability of electricity provision and to support distribution automation, in the 1960s electric utilities started integrating Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems in their grid infrastructures. SCADA is not a specific technology but generally refers to computer-based centralized systems implementing control applications for industrial processes. As shown in  1, a SCADA system usually consists of the following components: Remote telemetry units (RTUs): microprocessor-controlled devices responsible for: (i) interacting with sensors, (ii) converting sensor readings to standard data formats, and (iii) delivering sensed data to monitoring stations; Programmable logic controller (PLCs): minicomputers that are used as field devices for process control and machine automation (, to open or close circuit breakers at substations); A supervisory computer-based system that is composed of several remote units and a master station, and it is used to collect the data from RTUs, perform data analysis and send commands to PLCs; Databases for storing historical data, measuring trends and deriving forecasts; Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) to present a simplified representation of the system and its status to a human operator, who can make supervisory decisions; A communication infrastructure connecting the supervisory system to the other SCADA components.

11.Early SCADA systems were installed in substations and transmission networks, and they were using dedicated point-to-point communication links ( telephone lines or optical fibers) to connect the remote stations with the utility control center. Most vendors of SCADA products had developed simple proprietary communication protocols to connect the master stations with RTUs and PLCs . However, as SCADA solutions were widely deployed by electrical utilities to control and protect the power grid, some of those protocols, such as Modbus , emerged as standard de facto recognized by all major SCADA vendors, while power engineering standardization bodies started to release public standard protocols, such as IEC 61850 . Furthermore, the SCADA centralized architecture has also evolved over time, allowing more distributed processing and control, and the interconnection of different SCADA systems through wide-area networks . However, as explained in following sections, SCADA systems do not appear suitable for implementing the fully decentralized and autonomous control functions demanded by future smart-grid applications.

12.From the beginning of 1990s we are witnessing a rapid transformation of existing electric grids, which is driven not only by technological innovations but also by economical, regulatory and societal factors. Those changes impose new operational scenarios and technical challenges to power systems, which we outline in the following.

13.First of all, the soaring demand for new power supplies, and the increasing public awareness of the need of more sustainable sources of energy, are promoting the use of renewable energy resources (, wind and solar technologies) for power generation .According to various reports , half of the estimated 194 gigawatts (GW) of new electric capacity added globally during 2010 was derived by renewable resources. Although most of the electricity produced by renewable energy sources still comes from large-scale facilities ( wind farms, solar parks, and biomass power plants), situation is rapidly changing with the proliferation of small-scale distributed generators using renewable resources. Many argue that there might be many advantages in the distributed generation (DG) model . For instance, DG ensures that used, reducing power losses and congestion on transmission lines . However, as explained in Section , the existing distribution networks are not designed to handle power flowing from end users to substations, and this may negatively impact on distribution stability . Most importantly, renewable energy resources are intermittent and highly variable, and the uncertainty in energy supply can cause reliability problems or power quality degradations (, undesired voltage fluctuations) . This necessarily requires more sophisticated coordination and control techniques than those supported in current electric grids . Recently, utility companies have started introducing automated meter reading (AMR) systems in their distribution networks to remotely collect data from the meters (, consumption records, alarms) at customers’ premises . However, AMR systems are typically designed using simple one-way communication infrastructures that do not allow pervasive control of an electric grid .

14.Another factor that is contributing to the uptake of DG technologies is the deregulation of energy markets . More specifically, power systems are no longer national monopolies, but there are independent power producers selling electricity to utility companies, and independent operators maintaining and controlling regional transmission and distribution networks. Then, electricity prices are determined in an electronic auction market according to demand and supply principles . At least two types of electricity markets exist, which are regulated by different rules: (i) the wholesale electricity market for trading large amounts of energy between generators, system operators and retailers, and (ii) the retail electricity market, in which electricity retailers sell energy to end users . Following the dynamics of those markets, energy costs fluctuate, and prices raise as demands increase. The first consequence of this competitive market structure is that current power systems have increasingly ‘‘meshed’’ topologies, emerging from the interconnection of several smaller grids. Furthermore, energy trading across regional power grids is causing uncertainties in energy delivery that current electric grids are not well suited to handle. Finally, in liberalized market environments, small electricity consumers can exploit DG technologies to become potential producers. However, this requires improved system flexibility to preserve the reliability and stability of the power system.

15.The desire of reducing the environmental impact of our lifestyle is also fostering the market penetration of electric vehicles (EVs). However, the mass adoption of EVs is not without challenges for electric grids . On the one hand, EVs represent new mobile loads for the power system, which can significantly alter typical patterns of energy usage in households, while causing a dramatic soaring of electricity demands. For instance, the simultaneous charging of several EVs located in the same area can easily determine unexpected peak loads and rapid fluctuations of power demands in different parts of the electric grid . Therefore, new management capabilities are needed to regulate the recharging process of EVs with the objective of flattening aggregated power demands and mitigating load imbalances in power systems.

16.As introduced in Section 1 next-generation electric grids are commonly denoted as smart grids. Although there are slightly different views about the ultimate model of a smart grid, a consensus is forming about the new technologies and paradigms that are essential for the successful deployment of a smart grid, namely: ð1Þ advanced metering infrastructure, ð2Þ distributed energy resources, ð3Þ smart micro-grids, and ð4Þ vehicle-to-grid technologies .  2 provides a schematic view of the smart grid reference architecture used for the following discussion.

17.As previously observed SCADA and AMR systems were the first attempts to introduce simple digital communication capabilities in power systems. However, smart grid applications will need pervasive and real-time control of each grid component and not only of smart meters and substations. For this reason, a smart grid should incorporate a pervasive and scalable two-way communication infrastructure to enable more distributed command-and-control functionalities. One of the most important components of this communication infrastructure is the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) , which will be used to interconnect the smart meters (, electricity meters that incorporate networking and data management functionalities) installed at end customers’ premises with other control systems and data aggregators. Then, AMI systems can contribute in several ways to the realization of the smart grid vision. First, electric utilities can use AMI as data acquisition networks to monitor: (i) power quality, (ii) how much electricity is produced/stored by DER (distributed energy resources) units, and (iii) power consumption of household appliances. This large amount of metering data can be exploited to proactively identify failure conditions and anomalies and to take appropriate countermeasures, or to implement sophisticated techniques to regulate electricity usage patterns (, dynamic pricing or scheduling of residential loads).In a more general view, AMI networks can be foreseen to interconnect not only smart meters but also a variety of intelligent electronic devices (IEDs),1 which will be massively dispersed within smart grids. Communication architectures and technologies suitable for AMI will be analyzed in details in Section 5.It is also important to point out that AMI will allow smart grids to collect a huge volume of heterogeneous data from a large number of sources. How to efficiently aggregate, store and analyze this data is the subject of intensive research.
17-1.As previously observed SCADA and AMR systems were the first attempts to introduce simple digital communication capabilities in power systems. #relationship:B# 17-2.However, smart grid applications will need pervasive and real-time control of each grid component and not only of smart meters and substations. #relationship:A# 17-3.For this reason, a smart grid should incorporate a pervasive and scalable two-way communication infrastructure to enable more distributed command-and-control functionalities. #relationship:0# 17-4.One of the most important components of this communication infrastructure is the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) , which will be used to interconnect the smart meters (, electricity meters that incorporate networking and data management functionalities) installed at end customers’ premises with other control systems and data aggregators. #relationship:0# 17-5.Then, AMI systems can contribute in several ways to the realization of the smart grid vision. #relationship:C# 17-6.First, electric utilities can use AMI as data acquisition networks to monitor: (i) power quality, (ii) how much electricity is produced/stored by DER (distributed energy resources) units, and (iii) power consumption of household appliances. #relationship:0# 17-7.This large amount of metering data can be exploited to proactively identify failure conditions and anomalies and to take appropriate countermeasures, or to implement sophisticated techniques to regulate electricity usage patterns (, dynamic pricing or scheduling of residential loads).
17-8.In a more general view, AMI networks can be foreseen to interconnect not only smart meters but also a variety of intelligent electronic devices (IEDs),1 which will be massively dispersed within smart grids. 17-9.Communication architectures and technologies suitable for AMI will be analyzed in details in Section 5. #relationship:0# 17-10.It is also important to point out that AMI will allow smart grids to collect a huge volume of heterogeneous data from a large number of sources.

18.As discussed in Section , in existing power systems it is becoming increasingly common a more distributed generation of electricity. This trend is rapidly gaining momentum as DG technologies improve, and utilities envision that a salient feature of smart grids could be the massive deployment of decentralized power storage and generation systems, also called distributed energy resources or DERs. We have already mentioned that smart grids will facilitate the integration of small-scale renewable energy sources (, solar panels in residential applications), which will help to reduce demand for fossil-fuel power plants and to increase supply redundancy . Distributed energy storage is widely recognized as a key enabler of smart grids for its role in complementing renewable generation by smoothing out power fluctuations . For instance, surplus energy can be stored during conditions of low demand and supplied back during periods of heavy load. Moreover, energy storage systems generally have a quicker response than conventional power generators, and they can be used to increase system reliability . However, how to coordinate diverse DER technologies, which have different capabilities and characteristics (, energy capacity and time response functions), is not well understood yet.

19.As shown in  2, a smart micro-grid (or micro-grid for brevity) is a single, autonomous, self-sustainable power system formed by an interconnection of distributed energy resources, which serves various electricity customers (, residential buildings, commercial premises and small industries) located near one another . A micro-grid should be able to either operate integrated with the utility grid or disconnected (, islanded) from the distribution system. This also implies that a micro-grid should have its own management system to support the control functions needed to autonomously regulate electricity flows , as well as to participate into the energy market for electricity trading .It is important to notice that the micro-grid concept is not totally new and there are already many practical examples of micro-grid applications, such as industrial micro-grids, which provide highquality and reliable power to large industrial loads, or utility micro- grids, which serve loads in either densely populated urban areas or rural regions . However, we can expect a proliferation of SMGs in future power systems, and in particular of customerdriven micro-grids, which will be established though contractual agreements among residential customers . On the one hand, customer-driven (or community) micro-grids appear as the most suitable technology to optimize the deployment of DERs. On the other hand, micro-grids can also represent the best approach to tackle the complexity of pervasive deployment of intelligent and distributed control functions in electric grids.Indeed, each microgrid can be seen as a smart grid at a much smaller scale. Thus, many experts believe that a smart grid can progressively emerge through the peer-to-peer interconnection of an increasing number of micro-grids .

20.As pointed out in Section , the increasing use of EVs pose new challenges to electric grids because electricity demands will rise significantly. Thus, a considerable body of work is concentrating on defining control strategies to distribute spatially and temporally EV charging in order to avoid peak loads and to optimally utilize grid capacity . On the other hand, EVs can also offer many advantages to smart grids. Specifically, many studies have shown that during the day cars are parked most of the time, thus a large number of EVs can be assumed to be connected to a power socket at any given point in time . Consequently, when EVs are plugged into the electric grid their batteries can be used as backup energy storage systems. For instance, EVs can supply back part of their stored electric power to stabilize the electricity produced by intermittent renewable energy sources. This new power-generation paradigm is generally known as vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology . To some extent V2G technologies can be seen as a special case of DERs with the additional complexity that power sources are mobile .

22.One of the most important applications that smart grids should support is real-time wide-area situational awareness (WASA), which is defined as the ability to build a high-resolution description of the current state of the power grid over a wide area. Then, this information can be analyzed, for instance to predict the evolution of the power grid state under different operational conditions and energy control strategies .

23.Intuitively, WASA applications rely on a pervasive monitoring infrastructure to collect real-time data from widely dispersed sensors. The WASA monitoring system is expected to incorporate diverse types of sensors, including sources of non-electrical data, such as weather information that is used to predict changes in wind and solar power generation. Specifically, synchronized measurement technologies are emerging as an essential enabler for WASA applications, especially for power control and protection . The most advanced type of sensors based on this technology are the Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), which provide synchronized, real-time and high-resolution (up to 60 samples per second) measures of voltage and frequency parameters for the transmission lines they are connected to . Note that many system operators have already started deploying PMUs in their transmission networks .It is also important to point out that WASA applications impose stringent latency requirements, and communication delays are the dominant component in the total system delays. Thus, special attention should be dedicated to the proper design of a communication infrastructure that is capable of ensuring delay guarantees.

24.Another key component of aWASA application is the set of tools that are used to analyze the huge amount of raw and heterogeneous data received from multiple sources that exist in the power grid. Specifically, simulation tools suitable for large-scale power systems are needed to identify trends, diagnose undesired behaviors and to detect in advance potential vulnerabilities . How to combine simulation-based analysis of the power system with model-based analysis, with the objective of improving accuracy and convergence times of state estimation, is an important research topic . Finally, visualization tools should be developed to present the output of data analysis in an effective and flexible manner,  by combining geospatial information with electric information .

25.As observed in Section , in current electric grids, management functionalities are supported by utility control centers, which are typically implemented through distributed SCADA systems . However, it is widely recognized that in smart grids it will be necessary to adopt a more decentralized control model in which multiple autonomous and independent energy management systems (EMSs) cooperate to achieve desired control objectives by exploiting the information collected by WASA applications. Furthermore, EMSs should be capable of operating on different parts of the grid and at different scales . For instance, there will be home EMSs (HEMSs) to monitor and control the electricity usage in households, and building EMSs (BEMSs) coordinating multiple HEMSs to maximize the energy efficiency of entire buildings . At a larger scale, there will be EMSs providing advanced management and control services for substations, micro-grids  or other subsystems of the power grid .In general, several technologies beyond classical SCADA solutions can be considered to implement those EMSs, including service-oriented architectures (SOA), grid/ cloud computing, multi-agent systems, In particular, in Section  we will focus our attention on the large body of research work dedicated to the development of multiagent control systems for smart grids.

26.The term demand response (DR) is used to indicate a variety of mechanisms that smart grids will utilize to dynamically shape the electricity consumption of end users in response to energy supply conditions with the objective of improving the efficiency and reliability of electricity provision . As an example, significant savings in power generation costs can be achieved by flattening out peak demands. Furthermore, approximately 20% of the total power generation capacity is deployed as backup reserve for coping with peak demands but it is in use only 5% of the time . DR applications could help to obtain a more efficient utilization of the existing energy resources. The approach most commonly proposed for implementing DR applications is dynamic pricing. Basically, by adopting variable electricity tariffs the utility companies can incentivize customers to lower peak demands and smooth demand profiles by: (i) shifting some power-demanding household activities (, dishwashers) to off-peak periods, (ii) temporarily changing the settings of energy-demanding appliances, such as heaters and air conditioners, or (iii) activating residential power generators to supplement the electricity provided by the distribution grid .In the long term the expected potential benefits of DR would be to reduce overall electricity prices, and to significantly improve grid reliability and stability through a better spreading of electricity demands .It is also useful to point out that different control approaches can be used to achieve DR objectives . On the one end of the spectrum of proposed strategies there are pure customer-side techniques in which individual houses use real-time prices to make independent decisions about their energy usage profiles . On the other hand of the spectrum there are utility-driven techniques, commonly known as direct load control (DLC) mechanisms, which allow electric utilities to schedule power consumption of residential appliances .In general, the former approach requires more intelligent HEMSs, while the latter approach is easier to implement but it can suffer from scalability issues.

27.It is expected that the proliferation of DG technologies in smart grids could lead to a new paradigm for power generation, called virtual power plant (VPP). More specifically, a VPP consists of a large cluster of distributed power generators co-located with each other in a single site, which are jointly managed and controlled. A VPP produces a total capacity similar to the one of a conventional power plant . On the other hand, a VPP appears to the electricity markets and the grid system operators as a variable-size power plant ensuring more flexibility than conventional power plants . For instance, a VPP is expected to be able to react to changes in customers’ load conditions much faster than traditional power plants .In addition, the VPP approach could allow an easier integration of intermittent renewable resources into grid operations, because it implements the control functions needed to deal with power fluctuations. Finally, many studies argue that the VPP model provides an effective aggregation technique to control fleets of EVs as a single entity, thus facilitating the integration of V2G services into smart grids . However, a VPP is also a complex system and the development of suitable energy management systems that can be used to implement the VPP model is still an open issue.

28.There is a general consensus that standardization is one of the key issues in the design of smart grids .Indeed, the adoption of inter-operability standards for the overall system is a critical prerequisite for making the smart grid system a reality. However, a smart grid is a complex system that requires different layers of interoperability. For instance, standards for smart meters, smart devices, charging interfaces with electric vehicles are essential to facilitate market penetration of new smart grid products and services, as well as seamless interoperability between them. Similarly, all smart grid applications illustrated in previous sections require exchanges of information, for which interoperability standards are needed. Finally, a smart grid consists of many different domains and actors (, generation, transmission, distribution, markets, operations, service provider, and customer), and standard interfaces are needed among them.

However, each entity typically targets a different market sector or application scenario. For example, IEEE focuses mainly on standards that cover media-related interoperability problems ( message delivery over different communication technologies), while the activity of the IETF mainly covers interoperability issues related to transport and application areas.It is also evident that electrical industries can leverage many Internet- related standards to build a highly interoperable information and communication infrastructure for smart grids .In Section 5 we will explain the details of some of the most important communication standards that can be applied to the smart grid domain, while in the following we focus on the most representative standards for smart grid applications.

30.Within the IEC there are many Technical Committees (TCs) that are working on standards for smart grid applications, such as TC 57, which prepares standards for equipment and systems used in the control, protection and automation of power systems, including EMS and SCADA , or TC 13, which prepares standards for smart metering systems, for electrical energy measurement, and customer information and payment . Up to now, more than a hundred IEC standards can be identified relevant to the smart grid . In these core standards, IEC/TR 62357 describes a SOA-based reference architecture for power system automation and provides a framework to illustrate the interdependencies between all the existing object models, services and protocols in TC 57 . At the bottom level of this architecture there is the IEC 61850 family of standards, which specify communication networks and systems for power utility automation, with a special focus on substation automation . Note that the abstract data models defined in IEC 61850 have been mapped to a number of protocols that can run over generic TCP/IP networks and/or switched Ethernet. Other series of core standards define a Common Information Model (CIM) to standardize the exchange of information between different classes of applications, such as Energy Management related applications and electrical distribution systems. Data exchange for meter reading, tariff and load control is specifically addressed in the IEC 62056 series of standards . Finally, security aspects for the TC57 series of protocols are handled in the standard IEC 62351.

31.IEEE is also very active in the smart grid sector and it has recently launched a new project called P2030 to establish a framework for achieving smart grid interoperability . Up to now, nearly a hundred standards have been released or are under development, which cover different issues relevant to the smart grid, ranging from monitoring and control applications to communications over power lines . Of particular importance is the IEEE 1815 standard, which has ratified the Distributed Network Protocol (DNP3) standard for communications in electric power systems . DNP3 plays a crucial role in modern SCADA systems, because it is primarily used for reliable and secure communications between control centers and RTUs or IEDs.In addition, interoperability standards are under development to support a transparent mapping between IEEE 1815 and IEC 61850. With regard to monitoring applications, it is also important to mention the IEEE C37 family of standards, which defines communication protocols for real-time PMU data exchange . The series of standards IEEE 1547 provide guidelines criteria and requirements for interconnecting distributed energy resources to electric power systems, including standards for monitoring, information exchange and control .

32.In the vision presented so far, and widely accepted by utility companies, regulators and academia, the smart grid architecture requires the integration of the energy infrastructure, which is responsible for electricity generation, delivery and consumption, with a communication system, which provides support for automated and distributed monitoring, management and optimization functions . The communication system entails different technologies, components and services, and in this survey we analyze two of its major parts: Communication infrastructure. The communication infrastructure (or network) is responsible for providing the connectivity service among individual electric devices or entire grid sub-systems.In the context of smart grids, the key priorities of this communication network are: (a) to ensure reliable and real-time data collection from an enormous number of widely dispersed data sources, and (b) to support the various communication services (, multicast and group communications) that are needed by power control applications to distribute commands and configuration instructions in the power system. As explained in following sections, this communication infrastructure is envisioned as a collection of interconnected networks that will be structured into a hierarchy of at least three main tiers or domains: (1) local area networks for the access grid segment and the end customers, (2) field area networks for the distribution segment, and (3) wide area networks for the utility backbone. A variety of technologies, network topologies and communication protocols are considered for each of these categories .

32-2.The communication system entails different technologies, components and services, and in this survey we analyze two of its major parts: Communication infrastructure. #relationship:D# 32-3.The communication infrastructure (or network) is responsible for providing the connectivity service among individual electric devices or entire grid sub-systems. 
32-4.In the context of smart grids, the key priorities of this communication network are: (a) to ensure reliable and real-time data collection from an enormous number of widely dispersed data sources, and (b) to support the various communication services (, multicast and group communications) that are needed by power control applications to distribute commands and configuration instructions in the power system. 
32-5.As explained in following sections, this communication infrastructure is envisioned as a collection of interconnected networks that will be structured into a hierarchy of at least three main tiers or domains: (1) local area networks for the access grid segment and the end customers, (2) field area networks for the distribution segment, and (3) wide area networks for the utility backbone.

33.The middleware is a software layer running above the communication network, which provides communication and data management services for distributed applications, as well as standard interfaces between applications and smart grid devices. Different types of middleware solutions exist that differentiate from each other for the set of abstractions and programming interfaces they provide to applications, such as distributed objects, event notifications, distributed content management, synchronous/asynchronous communication functions, . Furthermore, middleware is increasingly used to create peer-to-peer (P2P) overlays, , distributed systems in which devices (peers) self-organize into a network and cooperate with each other by contributing part of their (storage, computing, bandwidth) resources to offer useful services, such as data search, distributed storage, or computational intelligence . Given the ability of P2P technologies to scale with increasing numbers of devices and services, several studies have proposed to use P2P-based middleware technologies to deal with the complexity of managing and controlling smart grids . In the remaining of this survey we take a bottom-up approach to describe the main approaches proposed in the literature to build communication and middleware solutions suitable for smart grids.  3 provides a scheme to guide the following discussion. We start in Section  from the communication infrastructure by analyzing the requirements that this component must meet in order to support smart grid applications. For the sake of clarity we categorize these requirements into two classes: (i) quantitative requirements, which define target performance metrics for data communications, and (ii) qualitative requirements, which define the functional characteristics that this communication infrastructure should exhibit . Then, we continue in Section  by overviewing the wired and wireless communication technologies that are applicable in the smart grid context, and we identify major advantages and limitations of each solution. Furthermore, the full specification of a communication architecture requires to define: (a) which are the communicating entities and how they are organized in network topologies, and (b) which are the communication protocols used to exchange messages in standardized formats and to support various communication services. Section  deals with the first topic, while Section  deals this the second one.

34.In the second part of this survey we concentrate on middleware platforms for smart grids. In particular, in Section  we focus on middleware techniques specifically designed for supporting data management services that are able to meet the scalability, reliability and real-time requirements of applications that must process, store and share data from a large number of heterogeneous data sources. For instance, as explained in the following sections, most applications for grid protection require that monitored data is delivered immediately and automatically to appropriate control entities. To ensure data availability and timeliness in such largescale and heterogeneous systems it is necessary to adopt more advanced data management models than classical client server or polling techniques. Furthermore, in Section  we also explore the key role of middleware technologies in supporting intelligent systems, and in particular multi-agent systems, which are used to provide flexible, decentralized and autonomous management functions in smart grids.

35.To conclude this survey in Section 7 we analyze a cross-layer issue affecting both communication infrastructures and middleware platforms, that is security and privacy. Some challenges will not be dissimilar from those of other large-scale telecommunications networks, but new vulnerabilities are due to the fact that smart grids are complex systems that integrate physical infrastructures with information and communication technologies.It is also important to point out that electricity must always be available in power systems. Thus, continuous availability must be considered the most important security objective in smart grids. On the contrary, in most telecommunications networks confidentiality and integrity are often considered more critical than availability. As described in following sections, this implies that security mechanisms for smart grids must operate in a timely manner and without interrupting the grid services.

36.There are several important issues in communication network design, such as: Which communication technologies should be used to establish links between devices. Which network topologies are applicable in the context of electric grid infrastructures, and how communication technologies and grid geography affect the topology of the network. Which networking and transport protocols are the most appropriate for meeting the requirements of smart grid communications. There is a general agreement that it is not possible to give a unique answer to the above questions because smart grids will operate in different environments and use cases. In the rest of this section we focus on discussing the main advantages and disadvantages of the different options that have been proposed in the literature, along with open issues and future research directions.

37.To identify which communication technologies are suitable for smart grids first of all it is necessary to specify the basic requirements that smart grid communication infrastructures should satisfy. Therefore, utility companies, research organizations and governments have elaborated several reports on the communication needs of smart grid services .In the following we list the most important requirements focusing on two categories: (i) quantitative requirements, which specify in a measurable manner the target communication performance demanded by the applications, and (ii) qualitatively requirements, which identify the capabilities that must be supported by the communication system.

38.The key communication requirements for smart grid applications can be summarized as follows.
38-1.The key communication requirements for smart grid applications can be summarized as follows.

39.Latency: In general most control and protection functions in power systems have tight delay constraints and require prompt transmission of information. For instance, in the case of distribution automation the IEDs that are deployed in substations should send their measurements to data aggregators within 4 ms, while communications between data aggregators and utility control centers require a network latency 68 12 ms . Other applications are less time-critical and can tolerate higher network delays (, most smart meters today send their readings periodically every 15 min).It is also important to point out that network latencies depend on several factors. Therefore, communications with low and stable latencies require a communication network specifically designed to optimize delay performance .

40.Reliability: Critical functionalities in smart grid require very high levels of reliability (up to 9999% reliability which corresponds to a total outage period shorter than one second per year) , which cannot be obtained if the underlying communication infrastructure does not support very reliable communications . Note that there is a number of possible causes for network failures, including link/node failures, routing inconsistencies, overloading, , which make necessary the use of different techniques to cope with them. However, redundancy (, multiple copies of the same messages, multiple paths used for the same information flow, multiple servers to execute a task, ) will be of paramount importance to ensure reliability in largescale networks.In addition, data may have different levels of criticality, and there are messages that can occasionally tolerate losses . Thus, the communication network should provide applications with the ability to select between different priority levels for data transmissions.

41.Data rate: The bandwidth requirements of smart meters and other sensors that are used in electric grids are typically modest (each meter reading requires about 300 kbps). However, bandwidth demands are growing and the bandwidth used by smart meters, PMUs and other IEDs will probably be in the range between 10kbps and 100kbps . Then, the data rate of the communication channel can become a serious concern, especially in the utility core backbone, due to the high number of IEDs that are expected to be connected to smart grids.It is also interesting to note that many studies argue that it will be necessary to overprovision the communication infrastructure in terms of channel bandwidth to ensure low transmission delays and reduce packet losses on transmission buffers .

42-1.The key capabilities for smart grid communications can be summarized as follows. 

43.Scalability: A smart grid can involve millions of users and even more devices. Thus, scalability is probably one of the most intuitive requirements for the smart grid communication system. However, there are different types of scalability, like load scalability (, the ability of the communication system to easily handle an increasing amount of data traffic or service requests) or geographic scalability (, a network that is deployable in a wide range of sizes and configurations). Similarly, different measurements of scalability can be considered, such as the size of routing tables as the number of nodes increases, or the amount of communication resources used by each node . Distributed communication architectures have emerged in the past to support Internet services in a scalable manner, such as peer-to-peer networks (P2P) , which could also be applied in the smart grid context. However, the scalability issue in smart grids is further exacerbated by the fact that most of the grid devices will be limited in terms of storage, computing and communication capabilities.

44.Interoperability: As pointed out above, and better described in the following sections, many different devices, communication technologies and networking protocols will be used in smart grids. Therefore, it is essential to ensure the interoperability between those different communication networks. Standards and open network architectures (, using non proprietary protocols like IP-based networks) will play a key role for interoperability at all the layers of the network architecture . On the other hand, networking elements could be introduced to provide translation services between different standards (, network gateways that route packets between different networks that use separate protocols).It is important to note that network interoperability is one face t of the interoperability problem, but application interoperability is also essential. For instance, application interoperability requires standards to ensure that applications assign the same meaning to exchanged messages.

45.Flexibility: Flexibility of the smart grid communication system is a multi-faceted concept. On the one hand, flexibility entails the ability to support heterogeneous smart grid services, which have different reliability and timeliness requirements. On the other hand, flexibility also implies the ability to provide different communication models. For instance, multipoint-to-point (MP2P) communications are important in monitoring applications, which require to periodically and simultaneously collect status information from a large number of sensors. Point-to-multipoint (P2MP) communications, or more in general group-based communications, are equally important because are used to distribute commands and configuration instructions to electric devices .In summary, there is a need for networking technologies and protocols with a high degree of flexibility and (self-) adaptability because the same communication infrastructure must satisfy the requirements of different applications running on top of it.

46Security: A smart grid is a critical infrastructure that needs to be robust against failures and attacks. Thus, stringent security requirements are imposed on its communication infrastructure in terms of resilience to cyber attacks and protection of customers’ privacy . For instance, the communication system must ensure that devices are well protected by physical attacks, unauthorized entities cannot have access to the metering information, or that sensitive data cannot be modified while in transit in the network. Similarly, the communication system must be robust against network attacks that aim at disrupting the communication services to damage electricity provision. Authentication, encryption, trust management, and intrusion detection are examples of important security mechanisms that must be supported in smart grids.

47.Communication technologies can be classified into two broad categories: wired technologies and wireless technologies. Generally speaking wired technologies are considered superior to wireless technologies in terms of reliability, security and bandwidth because cables are easier to protect from interference and eavesdroppers. Furthermore, the equipment is generally cheaper compared to wireless solutions, as well as the cost of maintenance. On the other hand, wireless networks ensures low installation costs and flexible deployments with minimal cabling, which are essential characteristics to rapidly provide network connectivity over wide areas or in areas where there is not a pre-existing communication infrastructure. Moreover, new approaches have been proposed to improve the energy efficiency of mobile-connected devices .In addition, recent advances in broadband wireless technologies are providing data rates and network capacities comparable to those of popular wired networks. For these reasons, electric utilities are increasingly relying on wireless technologies to build their communication infrastructures .

49.Traditionally, wired communication technologies were preferred by utility operators because were considered the most reliable option for a communication network. The most important wired technologies that are used in smart grids are: Power line communications (PLC). PLC technologies utilize existing power cables for information exchange . This allows utility companies to use a single infrastructure for both power and data transmission. For this reason, PLC systems have been proposed as a costeffective and straightforward solution to grid communication needs. As an example, the majority of AMR deployments around the world are using PLC technologies for transmitting metering data . However, the use of power lines to provide reliable data transmissions has to face a number of technical challenges due to the signal propagation characteristics of typical power cables, such as high signal attenuation, disruptive interference from other power signals, including nearby electric appliances or external electromagnetic sources .It is also important to note that there are two major families of PLC technologies that operate in different bands and have different capabilities. More precisely, there are narrowband PLC (NB-PLC) technologies that operate in transmission frequencies of up to 500 kHz. Within this frequency range, the resulting data rates are modest, from 1 bps to 10 Kbps up to 500 Kbps. NB-PLC can be used on both high and low voltage lines, and trial deployments have demonstrated that it is possible to cover very large distances (150 km or more) . The other category of PLC solutions includes broadband PLC (BB-PLC) technologies, which target significantly higher bandwidth performance than NB-PLC (up to 200 Mbps) by operating over much higher frequency bands (2 30 MHz). On the downside, the higher frequency bands that are used in BB-PLC reduce the maximum coverage and reliability of data communications. Thus, BB-PLC is mainly considered for in-home applications. Nevertheless, device manufacturers have recently announced new BB-PLC modems that can support data rates of about 10 Mbps up to distances of 8 km over transmission lines . Many standards have been developed or are under specification for the PLC systems described above. The most important industrial association that provides widely-adopted technology specifications for in-home PLC systems is the HomePlug Powerline Alliance. Over the past years this standardization group has released several standards, which have progressively enabled increasing channel rates, starting from 4 Mbps (HomePlug ) to 85 Mbps (HomePlug Turbo), and, more recently, 200 Mbps (Home- Plug AV and AV2).It is useful to note that HomePlug AV is a quite advanced technology that not only provides high-quality, multistream networking over power lines, but it also offers several co-existence operational modes. For instance, it is backward compatible with HomePlug , it enables inter-networking with devices using the IEEE 1901 standard (also known as Broadband over Powerline (BPL) technology) , and it is the first standard to allow hybrid home networks, combining wired and wireless devices . Finally, the HomePlug Alliance has also designed the HomePlug Green PHY (GP) Specification, which is a lower data rate, lower power version of HomePlug AV, fully interoperable with HomePlug AV and IEEE 1901 products, which is expected to significantly reduce power consumptions and costs.

50.In the last decades optical communication technologies have been widely used by electric utilities to build the communication backbone interconnecting substations with control centers . The major advantages of this communication technology are: (a) its ability to transmit data packets over distances in the order of several kilometers providing a total bandwidth of tens of Gbps (by aggregating multiple individual fibers), and (b) its robustness against electromagnetic and radio interference, making it suitable for high-voltage environments. For instance, several restoration and protection schemes have been devised for optical grids, which can overcome simple network failures by providing backup paths .In addition, a special type of optical cables, called Optical Power Ground Wire (OPGW), combines the functions of grounding and optical communications, allowing long-distance transmissions at high data rates. Thus, OPGWs have been used in the construction of transmission and distribution lines .It is reasonable to believe that fiber-optic communications will play a key role also in smart grids. Recent studies are also expanding the scope of optical communications by proposing the use of optical fibers to provide smart grid services directly to end customers , although the cost of fiber installation is recognized as an obstacle for the adoption of this technology.It is important to point out that the use of optical communications in access networks, also known as fiber-to-the-home (FTTH), is made possible by the advent of passive optical network (PON) technologies. Specifically, PONs do not require electrically powered switching equipment but they use only optical splitters to separate and collect optical signals as they move through the network. Furthermore, PONs enable a single optical fiber to serve multiple premises in a point-to-multipoint fashion, which permits to support network topologies suitable for access networks (, tree-based topologies) . Among the many variants of PON technologies, Ethernet PON (EPON) has been attracting much interest from grid operators because it enables the use of the standard Ethernet communication protocol over an optical network. This offers significant benefits over other PON solutions because it facilitates the interoperability with existing IP-based networks. 
50-1.In the last decades optical communication technologies have been widely used by electric utilities to build the communication backbone interconnecting substations with control centers . #relationship:0# 50-2.The major advantages of this communication technology are: (a) its ability to transmit data packets over distances in the order of several kilometers providing a total bandwidth of tens of Gbps (by aggregating multiple individual fibers), and (b) its robustness against electromagnetic and radio interference, making it suitable for high-voltage environments. #relationship:C# 50-3.For instance, several restoration and protection schemes have been devised for optical grids, which can overcome simple network failures by providing backup paths . #relationship:D# 50-4.In addition, a special type of optical cables, called Optical Power Ground Wire (OPGW), combines the functions of grounding and optical communications, allowing long-distance transmissions at high data rates. #relationship:A# 50-5.Thus, OPGWs have been used in the construction of transmission and distribution lines .

51.DSL generally refers to a suite of communication technologies that enable digital data transmissions over telephone lines. The main advantage of DSL technologies is that electric utilities can interconnect residential users to control centers avoiding the additional cost of deploying their own communication infrastructure. On the downside, a communication fee must be paid to the telecommunications operators maintain the network infrastructure. Note that there are a number of DSL variants, ranging from basic Asymmetric DSL (ADSL), which supports up to 8 Mbps in the downstream and up to 640 kbps in the upstream, to ADSL2+ with a maximum theoretical download and upload speed of 24 Mbps and 1 Mbps respectively. Very-high-bitrate DSL (VDSL or VHDSL) provides faster data transmission over copper wires (up to 52 Mbps downstream and 16 Mbps/s upstream), and on coaxial cable (up to 85 Mbps down- and upstream), but it can only operate over short distances. Second generation systems (VDSL2) promise to obtain data rates exceeding 100 Mbps in both upstream and downstream directions at a range of 300 m.

52.Nowadays, there are different technologies and standards for wireless communications, which can be easily classified based on their transmission ranges.In the following we overview the most important wireless technologies that are applicable to smart grids by going from the technology with the smallest coverage area to the technology with the largest one: 80-based networks. The IEEE 80 technology  is the reference standard that specifies the physical and MAC layers for low-rate, low-power and low-cost wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs).Indeed, the basic IEEE 80 physical layer offers data rates of 250 Kbps over distances of about 10 m, although alternate physical layer standards have been proposed that allow higher communication throughput . The supported network topologies are star (single-hop), cluster-tree, and mesh (multi-hop).In each type of topology there is a special node, called PAN coordinator, which is responsible for managing the entire network. Networks with tree or mesh topologies have also special nodes, called routers, that relay messages by establishing multihop connections between end devices and PAN coordinator. The standard also defines two different channel access methods that provide support for different power management mechanisms and channel sharing algorithms. Furthermore, within the 801 working group, a new task group, called 80 g, has been established to design PHY layer enhancements to legacy 80 suitable for smart utility networks (SUNs) . However, it is also known that IEEE 80 power management mechanism can lead to very low packet delivery ratios if the MAC parameters setting is not appropriate . A distributed algorithm is proposed in  to autonomously configure the 80 MAC layer to minimize the power consumption while meeting the reliability requirements of applications. It is important to point out that the IEEE 80 standard is the basis for many other industrial standards for monitoring and control applications. Among these industrial efforts the most important ones are the ISA 101a standard , the Wireless- HART standard , and the ZigBee standards . More specifically, the first two standards are primarily designed for industrial automation and control systems. They both use 80-based radios but they replace the 80 MAC protocol with a collision- free TDMA-based scheme. Furthermore, they both include additional adaptation layers to support distributed commandand- control applications. Note that WirelessHART is not a completely new technology but it is a backward-compatible enhancement of the HART Communication Protocol, which is an open standard commonly used in the automation industry for the last 20 years.In addition, in 2010 WirelessHART has been approved by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) as an international standard. Note that one of the main advantages of IEEE 80 over other shortrange radio technologies is the very low power consumption . However, ZigBee is certainly the most widely adopted technology for LRWPANs in both industrial and commercial environments because it is considered simpler and less expensive than other solutions. Specifically, ZigBee is a specification for a suite of protocols that extend the IEEE 80 standard with additional network management capabilities, security functions and application support sublayers. One of the most important features of the ZigBee standard is the definition of application profiles that allow multiple vendors to create interoperable products. These profiles provide a description of: (a) the devices supported for a specific application, and (b) the data formats, message types and communication models to be used by those devices. Relevant to smart grid is the ZigBee Smart Energy Profile (SEP), which provides an interface for managing appliances that monitor, control, and automate the delivery and use of energy . At the time of the writing two SEP versions exist, SEP 1.x and SEP . SEP  was developed in cooperation with other standardization groups, such as IPSO (IP for Smart Objects)  and HomePlug  industrial alliances.It offers new capabilities, such as control of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and apartment buildings.In addition, it integrates some IETF standards, such as 6LowPAN and ROLL , which will ensure full interoperability between ZigBee networks and IPv6-based networks. More details on those standards are reported in Section .1.IEEE 801-based networks (WiFi). The family of IEEE 801 standards, also known as WiFi, is certainly the suite of wireless communication technologies mostly used for home and local area networking. The main reasons of this success are: (i) WiFi operates in unlicensed  GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands, (ii) WiFi uses simple and flexible access schemes based on CSMA/ CA principles, and (iii) low-cost radio interfaces exist. The original version of the IEEE 801 standard was released in 1997 and clarified in 1999, but since then several amendments have been approved adding new features and extended capabilities. Today the vast majority of WiFi radio interfaces are dual band and they have the capability to transmit on the 5 GHz band using 801a physical mode, and also in the  GHz band using 801b/g/n physical modes . The highest data rates are supported by 801n, which integrates the OFDM-based transmission schemes used in 801a/g with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antennas to boost the maximum data rate of 54 Mbps supported in 801a/g up to 150 Mbps. Given the large number of data rates that are available, several algorithms have been proposed for dynamic rate adaptation . Note that the transmission ranges depend on a number of factors including transmission powers, antenna types, indoor or outdoor environments, and modulation schemes. Experimental studies indicate that reasonable outdoor ranges can be up to 300 m for 801n-based radio interfaces. Finally, the flexibility of 801 standard allow their use in various parts of the smart grid communication system, as better explained in Section . On the downside, CSMA/CA access schemes are less energy-efficient than TDMA-based schemes. Thus, various techniques have been devised to minimize the energy consumption of the WLAN interface, including power saving modes, packet compression and aggregation, or duty cycling during contention periods . Besides 801n, there are three other standards in the IEEE 801 family that are expected to be important for smart grid communications. The first one is the 801e standard  because it offers QoS features (, traffic prioritization, scheduling and admission control) that are suitable for delay-sensitive applications. The second one is the 801s standard , which defines mechanisms to support multi-hop transmissions and to build wireless mesh networks on top of the 801 physical layer. Finally, the third one is the 801p standard , which defines enhancements to basic 801 standard to support wireless access in vehicular environments. Thus, the 801p standard will be one of the key enabling technologies for V2G systems.IEEE 806-based networks (WiMAX). The IEEE 806 standard, commercialized under the name of WiMAX, was firstly released in 2001 to support long-distance (up to 7 10 km) broadband (up to 100 Mbps) wireless communications, especially in rural and suburban areas . Conceptually, IEEE 806 is conceived as a complementary technology to IEEE 801 because it is designed to support: (i) thousands of simultaneous users over larger areas,(ii) a connection-oriented control of the channel bandwidth, and (iii) more sophisticated QoS mechanisms than the traffic categories defined in 801e. On the downside, 806-based networks require a more complex network management and they operate on licensed frequency bands, which make 806 technology more suitable for network operators. As for 801, different versions of WiMAX technologies exist. The most recent version is the 2009 release , which includes many advanced features such as: (i) OFDMA, MIMO and various types of adaptive modulation and coding schemes, (ii) support for multicast and broadcast services, and (iii) seamless handover for nomadic users.In addition, different types of multi-hop relaying techniques are specified in the 806j standard  to enable larger coverage areas and more flexible deployments. Finally, an important evolution of the 806 standard family currently under development is the 806 m amendment , whose goal is to provide at least 100 Mbps data throughput at high mobility (350 km/h) and 1 Gbps at low mobility. Furthermore, 806 m will support handover with other radio access technologies, including 801 and cellular. Note that data rates and coverage ranges of 806 technologies make them suitable for connecting large facilities to utility control centers, as well as to deploy AMI networks in scarcely populated areas.

53.One of the main advantages of public cellular networks over other wireless communication technologies is the larger coverage area. For these reasons, in the past, utilities have extensively used cellular technologies, such as GSM, GPRS and EDGE, for data communications in SCADA and AMR systems . A shortcoming of cellular data services is that they are relatively expensive. Furthermore, cellular networks generally provide variable throughput and latency performance, depending on the number of other users served by the same base station. On the other hand, cellular networks are witnessing a rapid evolution and new generations of cellular technologies supporting higher data rates and more sophisticated data communication services are being developed. Today, the most widely commercialized mobile cellular systems are based on the third generation (3G for short) of cellular technologies. 3G standards are developed and maintained by the 3GPP industrial organization. UMTS systems, first offered in 2001, are still the most popular 3G standards. Among the various radio interfaces used in UMTS systems, the highest speeds are provided by the Evolved High-Speed Packet Access standard (HSPA+) , which can support data rates up to 168 Mbps in the downlink and 22 Mbps in the uplink. The successors of 3G standards will be 4G systems, which are designed to enable mobile ultra-broadband Internet access. A candidate 4G system under development by 3GPP is the Long Term Evolution (LTE) - Advanced standard, a major enhancement of currently deployed LTE systems . The main new capabilities introduced in LTE-Advanced with respect to previous 3G technologies include: (i) bandwidth and spectrum flexibility, (ii) an easier handoff between different networks, (iii) better support for heterogeneous network architectures ranging from macro-cells to femtocells, and (iv) more advanced mobile networking capabilities. Note that another candidate for 4G system is the 806 m technology, which was described in the previous section, although it is not targeting ubiquitous connectivity as LTE does.

54.Satellite systems support communications with variable bandwidth and latency performance using satellites stationed on orbits at different altitudes, including Low Earth Orbits (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), and Geostationary Earth Orbits (GEO) . Satellite systems using high altitude orbits have the advantage of not requiring tracking antennas, which are expensive. The downside is that they are affected by higher transmission delays (up to one second if link-layer acknowledgments are used). On the other hand, LEO satellite systems are less expensive to deploy. Traditionally, electric utilities have considered satellite communications for SCADA systems and other services provided in rural or geographically remote locations, which are either beyond the coverage of terrestrial communication networks, or it is difficult (and costly) to reach with dedicated fibers. Recent advances in satellite systems, with the development of smaller and low-cost stations, can open up new opportunities for the use of satellite communications in smart grids. For instance, satellite systems can be used to provide backup communication services at critical substations or backhaul transport services for AMI networks.
