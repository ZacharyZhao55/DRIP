1.The problem for many IT and Information Security departments is how to keep abreast of new and never-ending regulation and legislation and translate it into IT terms. This article reviews two of the more recent examples (Sarbanes–Oxley and Basel II), how compliance can be addressed in a more cost-effective fashion and how this is changing the role of Information Security.

2.Financial Institutions and Corporations both large and small are feeling the effect of having to comply with new regulation and legislation such as Sarbanes–Oxley (SOX) and Basel II, which are designed to protect investors and shareholders from corporate fraud,bad investment decisions and poorly controlled systems.

3.Organisations not directly affected by such regulation sometimes also have to comply because a customer who is impacted by such regulation requires its suppliers to demonstrate a similar degree of internal control (often referred to as ''SOX by proxy''). This has spawned ''lightweight'' versions of the compliance programmes.

6.Sarbanes–Oxley regulation is aimed at promoting better corporate governance and accountability and was introduced for US financial services companies following the Enron scandal. The Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, Section 404 (Management Assessment Of Internal Controls) requires the annual report to contain an ''internal control report'', which: confirms the responsibility of management for establishing and maintaining an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. and contains an assessment, as of the end of the issuer's fiscal year, of the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures of the issuer for financial reporting.

7.For companies registered on the US Stock Exchange, in addition to the financial audit where auditors give an opinion as to whether the accounts give a 'true and fair view' of the company's financial position, the auditor is also required to give 2 extra opinions: that they are satisfied with management's assessment of internal control effectiveness. that audit themselves are satisfied with both the design and the operating effectiveness of internal control.

8.Basel II seeks to buttress the capital structure and tighten up risk management in organisations regulated under the heading ''Credit institutions and investment firms''. Basel II requires closer alignment of the bank capital with the range of perceived risks. Basel I categorised credit risks in broad terms without taking into account the risk associated with a specific product. This is being rectified in Basel II by stipulating higher capital for higher risks and vice versa.

9.Basel II additionally requires capital provision for OPERATIONAL RISKS. The Basel II Committee defines OPERATIONAL RISK as ''The risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events''. Banks are required to have a process for assessing their overall risk, capital adequacy and strategy for maintaining capital levels and the process must be able to be demonstrated to the supervisor (regulator).

13.The Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) allows the capital charge to be driven by the banks' own operational loss experiences, within a supervisory assessment framework. Information about historical losses, coupled with mathematical modelling of likely exposure to risk, is used to predict capital requirement. The model must be transparent and be approved and requires the capture of data about losses (3–5 year loss history) in a Loss Database. The bottom line is that the regulator may grant an AMA waiver that allows a reduced capital charge if the organisation can prove that it has implemented: qualitative and quantitative risk management standards. a risk management methodology. and adequate controls to mitigate risk.

20.During this process of monitoring impending regulation and legislation, the key is to identify the impact on IT. This means wading through the text of such documentation, although a few global searches for keywords such as ''information'', ''technology'', ''control'' and ''security'' often yields the defining clauses. This is then best done by Information Security, working with the Compliance Champion.

21.The objective is to identify references to Standards of Good Practise that are being advocated by the regulator. For example: For Sarbanes–Oxley, the PCAOB (Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) in the U.S. produced Auditing Standard No. 2 – an Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Control Performed in Conjunction with an Audit of Financial Statements. This states that ''COSO's publication 'Internal Control – Integrated Framework' (also referred to simply as COSO) provides a suitable framework for purposes of management's assessment'' . ''Other suitable frameworks have been published in other countries .. Although different frameworks may not contain exactly the same elements as COSO, they should have elements that encompass all of COSO's general themes. The auditor should therefore be able to apply the concepts and guidance in Auditing Standard No. 2 in a reasonable manner if management uses ''a suitable framework other than COSO''. In the UK (and Europe) this is accepted to be COBIT.

24.For Basel II, in the UK, CP142 Annex B: Draft Guidance on Operational Risk Systems and Controls for SYSC, risks must be identified and mitigating controls must also be put in place for People, Processes and systems and External events. The FSA handbook (Senior management arrangements, Systems and Controls Section – SYSC) states that ''Security should have regard to established security standards such as ISO 177991 (Information Security Management)''. The documentation that provides such guidance in other countries will be drafted by the local regulator.

25.This, of course, does not mean that the organisation needs to become BS7799 Certified but rather that it should be able to demonstrate that risk is being managed according to the good practise defined in this standard. Whilst ISO 17799/27002 may be a work of reference for many Information Security Managers, it might also come as a surprise just how many gaps might be found to exist should a formal risk assessment be conducted, followed by a gap analysis of the controls required to mitigate risk.

26.Basel II also requires an integrated risk management process ranging from corporate risk assessment at the top to technical risk assessment for a specific project. Information Security Managers will need to ensure that there is a formal, repeatable and consistent risk management process that can be used to assess risk Information, Hardware Software and People assets whether a core switch or information entered to an input field in a new e-commerce site (Microsoft's threat and risk assessment approaches (STRIDE and DREAD) may be a useful approach for the latter).

31.Sarbanes–Oxley requires identification of the systems which process information which will have a material impact on the financial statements. These systems and their underlying delivery and support systems are then assessed typically using the COBIT framework. Any gaps are identified and remediation is instigated. The IT implications can be huge and costly (ranging up to £80 million) for large organisations, since assessment spans the 4 COBIT domains: Where further guidance is required on the controls associated with service delivery and service support, organisations typically turn to ITIL ((the IT Infrastructure Library) from the UK Office of Government Commerce) best practices.

32.Confusingly for most people involved in SOX projects, assessment of business continuity is not a concern, although, of course, the ability to restore data is. The SOX concern is over the control and security of information that reaches the financial accounts rather than on business sustainability. Many organisations have come unstuck here due to a lack of planned testing for the ability to restore both system and data files. This not only ensures that backups contain meaningful data but also that old media can still be read.

37.The main focus on Basel II from an IT perspective is on the mitigation of operational risk (and Basel II then plugs the gap left by SOX with respect to Business Continuity Plans). In the UK, the FSA handbook (Senior management arrangements, Systems and Controls Section – SYSC) defines 3 areas where risk must be assessed and controls applied: People – risks arising from employees, should be mitigated by controls such as: Defined responsibility and authority, Training, Payment methods that do not encourage fraud, Similar controls where processing is outsourced. Processes and systems – automation reduces risk of human error and facilitates segregation of duties but increases dependency on IT and increases risk of loss of confidentiality, integrity, availability and repudiation of transactions so controls should include: Adequacy and security of internal documentation that would allow on-going operation and recovery ,Due diligence on the accuracy, legality and confirmation of contractual arrangements, Segregation of duties facilitated by IT organisation structure, Appropriateness of systems acquisition, Access controls and firewalls, Controls over authorisation, completeness and accuracy, Controls to prevent non-repudiation, Availability controls. External events and other changes – the risks of unexpected events should be mitigated by: Adequate change management processes, Contingency arrangements to maintain the continuity of its operations, Resilience to disruption caused by systems failure and loss of key staff.

39.Before entering into, or significantly changing, an outsourcing arrangement, a firm is required to: Ensure a fit with the firm's reporting structure. business strategy. overall risk profile and ability to meet its regulatory obligations. Conduct appropriate due diligence of the service provider's financial stability and expertise. Consider business continuity risk implications that may arise if a single service provider is used by several firms. Ensure that its own contingency arrangements allow business continuity in the event of a significant loss of services from the service provider. Have regard (during contract negotiation) to reporting or notification requirements, information ownership rights, confidentiality agreements, Chinese walls to protect client and other information and the adequacy of any guarantees and indemnities that it may wish to impose on the service provider including rights of audit.

41.The FSA also advises firms to ''consider using externally validated reports commissioned by the service provider, to seek comfort as to the adequacy and effectiveness of its systems and controls''. An example of such a report is an SAS 70, which is a third-party external auditor assurance of internal controls at a service organisation, including controls over IT and processes. There are two types of SAS 70: An SAS 70 'Type I' review tests the design of the service organization's stated internal controls at one point in time. An SAS 70 'Type II' review tests both the design and the operational effectiveness of the controls over a period of at least 6 months.

42.An SAS 70 Type II might be sourced by Outsourced Service Providers who host systems that are subject to SOX review. A client organisation cannot outsource its responsibility for SOX so either the outsourced service provider must allow repeated audit testing of its services by each client or commission the testing from a trusted third-party, in order to save the disruption of repeated client audits. However, the cost may be passed onto the clients by charging for the report. This should still be cheaper for the client than conducting the review themselves. The client should either define the scope of the SAS 70 review with the outsourcer, based on the controls over which comfort is required, or ensure that the scope is adequate if the outsourcer has defined their own scope.

44.All the above, of course, are basic good practise. For banks going for the AMA approach for calculating the capital charge required to cover operational risk, Basel II requires data about operational loss to be collected as part of the evidence that risk is being managed. This requires the identification of key IT risk indicators and capture of loss data and data about 'near misses'. This is a key role for Information Security, in liaison with Operational Risk Management.

45.A near miss is an unusual/undesired event or sequence of events or observation of unusual occurrences which did not cause a loss but which had the potential to do so and which provides an early warning, allowing operation to be improved to prevent such a loss arising.

46.The information collected should include the following: Business unit/service line, , Loss category,, Internal fraud, External fraud, Employment practices and workplace safety, Clients/Products/Business Practices, Damage to physical assets, Business disruption þ System Failure, Execution, delivery and process management, Loss amount, Loss period (start/end date), Loss method ( regulatory fines, class action settlement, restitution, cost to recover), Recovery amount, Causes/reasons for operational failure, e.g: System involved/cause/sub-cause, Control procedures that were in place, Event trigger ( employee discrimination, bribe), Contributory factors ( lack of segregation of duties and lack of proper employee supervision) – this will require a formal root-cause analysis of the loss, Unlike credit and market risk data, data about operational risks ( loss of service) were either not collected at all, were not available in a meaningful format or were not subjected to an impact assessment. The challenge is now to record this information in a meaningful way, how is quantified data to be captured about: A service error that adversely impacts a client relationship. Employee incompetence in general. (Scoring techniques.)

47.Some data will be collected for the first time, but other data sources already exist within the organisation and it is a matter of finding where they reside, e.g: data about employee turnover, number of employees 'fiddling' expenses is generally collected by HR. IT incidents are usually tracked by an Incident Management System (Basel II can leverage off these).

48.The ultimate goal is to identify the patterns of events that if spotted in future can serve as a warning signal of danger ahead. Management and the regulator will want to know not only what losses have occurred and why but also whether the risk is increasing or decreasing and information should be fed to management dashboards in a meaningful format for understanding the current level of risk.

50.The regulatory recommendations of the implementation of controls and security, following recognised but different standards of Good Practise can result in compliance teams re-inventing the wheel. For example, the SOX team may be conducting a gap analysis against COBIT, but they do not talk to the Basel II team, who are conducting a gap analysis against ISO 17799. Duplication of effort/inefficiencies due to a silo approach (no coordinated assessment of impact of new regulation/legislation) has a number of disadvantages: it puts resource pressure on other projects. more important projects ( safety) may be delayed. a ''throw-away and start again'' approach is costly.

51.Consequently, a sustainable, iterative approach is needed that is flexible and can be refined over time to incorporate new requirements and prevent unnecessary duplication of documentation. The key is to identify: Any similarities (overlap) and leverage off these. identify controls dictated by each regulatory requirement. establish which controls are already in place and documented in the controls database. Any differences. the difference is in the detail (identify new control requirements). use Standards of Good Practise as a baseline to identify control requirements.

53.A cohesive view of risk cannot be achieved within the Risk Function alone – all aspects of the business are implicated from the ''tone at the top'' (in terms of risk appetite and tolerances, control environment and culture, operating and assurance models, ) to detailed infrastructure risk assessment, risk technologies and architecture, risk training.

54.KPMG has been working with clients to develop a structured and rigorous system to enable the organisation to view its key risks, processes and controls in a meaningful way. The objective is to identify the core thematic areas and components where evidence is required to enable management to affirm compliance with statutory, regulatory and business requirements. This is done by taking an 'SOX-lite' approach and creating a Regulatory Compliance Framework and associated methodology in which the financial components over which assurance is required are identified, and mapped to: he applicable laws and regulations. and map these to COBIT and ISO 17799 (2005) controls.

57.Another benefit of such a framework is that should an infrastructure component or process be changed, the change control process should use the framework to trigger an identification of the impact of the change on the applicable laws and regulations so that the necessary re-testing can be performed.

58.The Regulatory Compliance Framework should also help maintain the compliance continuum,  assist with the year-in, year-out testing of compliance with various regulatory requirements without conducting the same test repeatedly for each piece of regulation. we can test once and then tick off all regulations that are satisfied by this test. Of course this will require that the various compliance committees have buy-in to the framework.

Monitoring and reporting of controls effectiveness. Regular capture of metrics on controls success to indicate where preventative or detective controls should be strengthened. This in turn will complement the Basel II requirement for the capture of metrics to evidence that risk is being managed.

62-1.How does this change the role of Information Security.

63.As we have seen in the previous sections, Information Security has a key role to play in achieving regulatory and legal compliance. Information Security Managers will need to: play a greater role in assessing and addressing IT risks. This will mean ensuring that there is a formal, repeatable and consistent risk management process that can be used to assess risk Information, Hardware Software and People assets whether a core switch or information entered to an input field in a new e-commerce site. maintain an awareness of the latest regulation and legislation by liaising with the compliance and legal departments and mapping this to the relevant policy and the relevant controls in COBIT, ISO 17799 or other Standards of Good Practise to identify the gaps and required controls. provide a baseline set of security requirements, and service levels with which Outsourced Service Providers must comply (and which should be incorporated into or referenced from the contract). liaise with Operational Risk Management to define the key risk indicators and capture of loss data that can be used to show whether risk is being well managed. Such metrics are best presented using a 'management dashboard' in which a summary of trends across a set of key performance indicators is presented graphically using a balanced scorecard approach. This should allow drill down to finer detail for supporting evidence.

64.Of course, the regulator is only one of many potential target audiences for such metrics. The metrics should also be able to be used to demonstrate: the effectiveness and efficiency of security controls in achieving both security and control objectives and in achieving business objectives (the latter requires an understanding of the CEO's agenda and the CIO's agenda. the need for improvements to the protection of the assets for which Information Security is responsible, thereby influencing business strategy as well as IT strategy and the selection of security products. the cost of dealing with security incidents. the need for additional security expenditure. the worth of the Information Security function and its ability to handle change and incidents successfully.

65.These will all require different aggregation and abstraction depending on the target audience and the information to be presented will determine the data that must be captured. This, in turn, will require the regulatory and legislative requirements to be considered during the project initiation stages of projects so that the capture of base data can be designed into systems and processes rather than being considered as an afterthought. KPMG's Security team within IT Advisory helped a number of multinational clients identify metrics such as these and present them effectively to both external and internal audiences.
