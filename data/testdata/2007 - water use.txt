1.Report on the history of irrigation water conserving credits, including the balance, how much earned, and how much used, and drought quantities. Know who uses them and who has accumulated them, and be able to report on an individual basis, by a geographic area, or aggregate the data.
2.View the spatial impact of a person's application with other active applications on-line so the applicant or evaluator has a visual of who else is available to compete for quantities with. Also include application and permit data on-line, either with scanned documents or access to database.
The historical data should also be available, but viewing restrictions for certain legal documents has to be followed. Be able to query by geographic area or permit number.
3.Heat map for water quality. Add the District WUPnet sentinel wells on this map - those are the District wells that have been in existence the longest time and we have the best data with. So if we bring them up in an area we know we have reliable data.
4.Track ownership of wells or permits over the life of the withdrawal point so the relocated quantities can be traced from owner to owner.
Quantities that are relocated will have certain restrictions placed on Quantities that are relocated, as well as any quantities that remain on the original permit.
For permits that have multiple withdrawal points, we need the ability to track ownership of specific withdrawal points over time.
5.Have a heat map that shows permit information for specific time periods.
You should be able to input a geographic area (whether by county, department, or entire District area), select the time period(s) you want, and select one of two views: permits issued or active permits in that time period, and produce .Have a heat map that shows permit information for specific time periods show the locations.
On a high-level view, you need to be able to see the locations with the predominate use type reflected on the map itself, and include a graph or chart showing the total number of permits, predominate use shown by %, and the time period involved. If you click on it, bring up the permit details, such as name, permit number, issue date, expire date, use type, wuca, and average quantities.
6.Automate some of the requests that Jim Whalen receives.
The majority of request are related to permitted and pumpage quantities, both at the permit level and well level.
The majority of request are usually sorted temporally or geographically.
7.Ability for public utilities and internal staff to find existing permits in or near public utilities and internal staff service area so public utilities and internal staff can spatially see what water is available, or may become available, when public utilities and internal staff plan for public utilities and internal staff future growth and water resources.
public utilities and internal staff will need to view the use type (interested mainly in agricultural and mining), owned acres, and the current permittee's contact information.
8.Ability to pull a well package that provides a view of water use at a particular time that is then plugged into models used to generate water use amounts. The data would include wells, land elevation, aquifer, and total and cased depths.
9.Must be able to track trends in land use and water use changes. These include several means by which a proposed new withdrawal that impacts an MFL waterbody can achieve a "Net Benefit," including the provisions for relocated, lapsed, and water withdrawal credits.
10.Have map be able to show quantity of pumpage. Hover over or click a point in the map and see the average rolling 12, peak month, and max month compared to the pumpage of the well. Also get the cumulative quantities for an area you enter manually.
11.Provide the ability for applicants or District staff to compare the percentage a permit is over-pumping, based on use type, against the regional average for the same use type. The region would be the area that fell within the buffer distance entered, and the time of interest would also be entered.
12.Need to know what aquifer is being pumped from. There are permitting constraints in ETB MIA that no additional water from the Floridan Aquifer can be pumped, but no additional water from the Floridan Aquifer is allowed from Intermediate aquifer.
13.Select water use data temporally or with geographic overlays, which can be from another layer or graphics on the page. Also be able to place the page in an Excel spreadsheet.
14.Select water use based on predominant use, use types, and regions they fall in. water use based on predominant use would be agricultural, industrial, mining & dewatering, public supply, and recreational.
Each predominate use is further broken down into more detailed categories, such as melons or citrus for the agricultural predominate use. This needs historical data for trend analysis.
15.Support extraction or reporting of data for ad-hoc geographic areas by using spatial queries such as graphics or polygon buffering.
The ability to aggregate the data must be there and any type of polygon should be able to be used.
16.Create layer that shows the Developments of Regional Impacts (DRI) and their status. layer that shows the Developments of Regional Impacts (DRI) and their status will be plugged into the new model for population projections and water supply demand projections.
17.Obtain report of those out of compliance of permit conditions by over-pumping their allowable quantities. Show how much over pumping is done, and have option to select by time period or by area. Need to break down to a permit-by-permit basis, but also show the whole thing on a map.
18.Minimum aquifer level - The saltwater intrusion MFL is met when the moving 10-year AFL is at or above MFL for five consecutive years. MFL is not met when the 10-year moving AFL in the reference wells is below MFL for two consecutive years.
19.Minimum flows on the upper Peace River - The MFL is met when The MFL's are at or above the established MFL for three consecutive years. Once the established MFL has been considered met, if the established MFL is followed by two years where the established MFL is not met within a rolling ten-year period, then the AFL shall be considered below the established MFL.
A determination of whether the AFL's are meeting the established MFL is made at each one of the established minimums (Bartow, Ft Meade and Zolfo Springs).
20.Minimum lake levels - The proposed MFL is achieved when the long-term P50 is at or above the MFL and the long-term P10 is at or above the High Minimum Lake Level for five consecutive years.
Once in compliance, The proposed MFL is not met when the long-term P50 is below The proposed MFL for two or more consecutive years or the long-term P10 is below the High Minimum Lake Levels for two or more consecutive years.
21.Use system to publish a chart or graph that compares the MFL to a running average of AFL's. This should reflect how AFL's are moving along the MFL line and indicate how different resources impact the MFL. The resources to include are pumpage, new projects, and rainfall. It will probably be run on a monthly basis.
22.Link between Water Use Permits (WUP), Environmental Resource Permits (ERP), and Well Construction Permits. One use would be as a means of notifying appropriate District staff when pertinent land use changes. (ie want to know if an ERP is issued or applied for a subdivision where permit has been issued for a farm).
23.Ability to provide external customers a means to query and view application information and locations by entering spatial, temporal, or data specific information. Current applications satisfying the criteria would be viewed immediately; future applications would be e-mailed.
24.Need tool to be able to estimate water use (now being done in SAS). To do this estimate, you need to be able to query the water use data with various variables, such as time period, use types, withdrawal type (groundwater or surfacewater), and geographic areas. Once the initial query is complete, you need to be able to refine the resulting data set. An example is when you select active permits in a time period. If a permit expired inside of the time period, the refine tool would help determine if that permit would or would not be a part of the result set, perhaps by determining at what point in the time line the refine tool expired.
25.Capture crop report data and link it with the corresponding use quantities, so you can observe changing crop patterns, see where land has shifted out of crops, and track water use per planted acre per crop to see patterns in water use by geography. The accumulation (or depletion) of credits by geographic area could point out potential problems in permitting in specific geographic areas. It may point to soil type or local cultural practice problems. Link to requirement JY4/SR7, the report of water credits used and earned.
26.The external users need to be able to click on an area and obtain data for the surrounding area, such as lapsed quantities, historical use, and adjacent permits.
Need to support decision-making on the applicant's part, especially when their request does not meet the MFL requirements.
